# Lab-5: Create a COVID-19 Dashboard using Cognos Analytics

## Introduction

This lab will build a series of Cognos Dashboards to display COVID-19 data.

## Objectives

The goal of the lab is to familiarize the user with the use of the Cognos Analytics web-based business intelligence suite. IBM Cognos Analytics contains integrated toolsets for reporting, analytics, and visualization. This lab will focus on the visualization component.
We will be creating three tabs similar to those on the IBM & Weather Channel COVID-19 Dashboard. IBM created a data fabric pulled from state and local governments as well as the World Health Organization. Where the public dashboard updates dynamically based on daily data pulls, we will use extracted data tables for the lab to build visualizations for a specific set of dates.

After completing this lab you will be familiar with these features of Cognos Analytics:

1. Access the Cognos free trial
2. Create a "COVID-19 Cases Dashboard"
3. Create a global map view
4. Add a webpage tab.
