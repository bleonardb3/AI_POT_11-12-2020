# Lab 1: Develop Socioeconomic Annotators for COVID-19

## Introduction
This lab will cover the development of socioeconomic annotators for COVID-19 in order to create a COVID-19 vulnerability index. IBM Watson Knowledge Studio will be used to develop the socioeconomic annotators. 

## Objectives
The goal of this lab is to familiarize the user with the Watson Knowledge Studio service. Watson Knowledge Studio lets you build a machine learning annotator by applying a type system, dictionary pre-annotator and human annotation on a training corpus of unstructured documents. Upon training and evaluation, the machine learning annotator can be saved and deployed to Watson Discovery for automated entity extraction.  

After completing this lab, you will be able to perform the following exercises: 
1.	Provision an instance of Watson Knowledge Studio
2.	Provision an instance of Watson Discovery
3.	Create a type system
4.	Create a dictionary
5.	Upload a corpus of documents
6.	Perform manual annotation
7.	Train and create a machine learning (ML) annotator
8.	Save and deploy the ML annotator to Watson Discovery
