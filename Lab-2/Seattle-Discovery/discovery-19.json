Ideally no more than a 30-45 min bus or bike ride to downtown/south lake union \n3. Safe (feel safe as a woman walking around or taking dog out at night)\n4. Preferably has a suburban feel (not a lot of businesses, quiet, near nature, etc) \n5. Beach, lake, or trail access within walking distance \n\nThank you!",
