  "text": "Hi - \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI currently live in san diego and might be moving to seattle. I have a great job offer but I love the 364 day good weather, sunshine, and laid back vibe of san diego. I currently live in a pretty boring suburb with amazing freeway access near a university and would love to find something similar with a reasonable commute to downtown where I'll be working should I take this job. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI checked the FAQ but couldn't find info on specific neighborhoods besides that its easier to find a house if you know what neighborhood you want. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been to kirkland before and LOVED it but my recruiter said it's far from downtown where I'd be working.",
