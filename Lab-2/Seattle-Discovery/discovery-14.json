  "text": "So I got laid off last month and applied for unemployment benefit but i got disqualified due to retirement payment (im guessing my last contribution to my 401k overlapped with the period they were inspecting) so im in the process of filing a dispute. My unemployment claim is still active though. Anyways I need to move in less than 4 weeks and I applied for MFTE housing since unemployment benefit counts as income. However now im worried that Iâ€™ll get rejected for the MFTE application process because my unemployment claims got denied but as I said, the claim is still active and open. And on the MFTE website, it says that need to be able to present statement from unemplotment benefit. Does anyone know how this works? Would I get rejected?",
