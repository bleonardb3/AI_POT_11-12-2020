  "text": "Hello! I just had a question. I have a few other “inactive” claims because i originally did not meet the criteria for benefits but now I do. The “active” claim is from April 12 and was paid on the 18th. So how do i file a new one for this week? Do i go into this active claim and click the “Reopen claim for benefits” “claims restarted today will have a restart date of april 19” Is this how you “re-file a claim” weekly so that i can get benefits for that week? Or do i have to open a completely new one? Thank you for your time!!",
