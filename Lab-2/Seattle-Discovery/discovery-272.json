  "text": "I've seen a fair few posts from people incredibly concerned about the unemployment process.\n\nI just had my claim go from 'pending' to 'processing' and it took zero time on the phone. I'm a couple days away from getting paid out for 3 weeks and feeling much better about keeping my head above water.\n\nI wanted to share my experience to hopefully help others have a maybe just that tiny bit more faith in the system.\n\nI filed on March 12th (just before some of the really big weeks we've seen for new claims). My standby status was quickly denied. My claim application went into adjudication after a couple days.\n\nI checked the FAQ and covid19 pages and saw that I was really just suppose to twiddle my thumbs for 3 weeks. \n\nI applied for a couple jobs (regardless of my chances of being hired) and submitted my first claim.\n\nThe Standby status was redetermined and Approved without filing an appeal or contacting anyone.\n\nI kept filing my claims each week. No more job search needed.\n\nAfter 3 weeks I sent an email via the ESD portal.\n\nAfter another 4 days my application had been updated. 'Pending' next to each week and a bunch of zeros is now 'Processing' with my weekly benefit amount.\n\nI spent zero time on hold. I ate some ramen. I drank less. I smoked less. I used some savings and some credit card balance. It's a pandemic. I think I've gotten off pretty light so far, all things considered.\n\nThe ESD is getting crushed right now. Be as patient as you can afford. Be as polite as you can manage. Everyone at ESD is working hard to get you paid. It'll work out in the end. No government program is without it's shenanigans.\n\nIf you need money asap do some googling. WA state has emergency relief funds and right now there are a wide variety of groups helping pay individual bills. It's not easy to find or attain necessarily, but there's help out there.\n\nMay the force be with you.",
