  "text": "Maybe it's just pandemic fever, but I'm considering moving to Olympia and commuting to Seattle 2 - 3 times per week (and WFH the other 2 - 3 days).  I can just get \\_so\\_ much more house there and be surrounded by forrest, live in a cul de sac, etc.  I figured my commute would be:  \n\\- Drive from Olympia to Lakewood  \n\\- Take the Lakewood - Seattle Sounder (and \\_hopefully\\_ get to work on the train)  \n\\- Leave work \\~1hr early and work on train for ride back  \n\\- Drive from Lakewood to home  \n\n\nIs this a feasible plan?  Is even 3x a week too much?  I'd like to be able to continue to stay available for more job prospects (I'm a Cloud Infra Eng (aka DevOps-y stuff) in the future with the assumption that a new job would require me to be in the office 3x a week still.\n\nAnyone else doing this already?  \n\n\nThanks in advance!",
