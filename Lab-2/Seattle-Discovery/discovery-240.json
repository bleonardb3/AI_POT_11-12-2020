  "text": "Hello Seattle!  I'm a freshman and first-generation, so I'm practically dealing with this sort of thing alone. I'm lost and need guidance.  Basically, the landlord won't let us terminate our lease. Obviously, we signed a contract, but due to the closure of my university, there was no point in living in the apartment.  But, I mean, after **legal advising,**  I'm not entirely at the fault of being \"irresponsible\" of prematurely ending my lease.   After sending in my notice of termination, he said no. So, I was advised to write a letter with claims, listing some RCWs to just anecdotally bad experiences, hoping to have some sort of negotiation started or a yes to a termination. Or, at least a paper trail.   **Question: is there any RCW or codes or any legal statement that requires the landlord to have a contract indicating a section for prematurely terminating the lease? This entire time I've lived here was sus af. So, I'm just hoping that there is regulation with contracts of that sort.**   I'm not sure if this is an appropriate question under this subreddit, but thanks for the help! This whole freshman year has been a mess at this place, looking for sympathy and support and not being scolded online, lol.",
