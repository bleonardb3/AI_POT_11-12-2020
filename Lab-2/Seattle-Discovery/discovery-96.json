I know all the state parks and national parks are closed for now and i don't plan to run into any crowd or cause any trouble. If i just want to drive around with my family and see some beautiful scenes outside (may stop somewhere but not planning to hit any trails). Any recommendations? I may drive through fast food for lunch. Thanks.",
