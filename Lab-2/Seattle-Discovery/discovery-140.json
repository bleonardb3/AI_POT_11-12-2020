  "text": "So with the extra $600/week, Iâ€™m just trying to figure out how this works. Originally, when I filed for UI I was told that I had a max benefit amount of $4000. (So low because I am a full time student and only had part time job). Does this extra $600 just essentially give me that $4000 faster, or is it separate from my Max benefit amount?",
