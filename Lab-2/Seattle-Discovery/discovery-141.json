  "text": "Hey guys! First off, does anyone know when the unemployment website will be fixed? I haven’t been able to file my weekly claim yet for last week, which sucks... Also, has anyone received their unemployment benefits yet? I filed March 23 and I still haven’t received any money, which is starting to become a huge strain financially. Thanks in advance!",
