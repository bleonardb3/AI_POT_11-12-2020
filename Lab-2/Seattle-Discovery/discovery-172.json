  "text": "I have been out of the country since late October.  I am past due to come home but the company has restricted travel and the area I am in has restricted flights in and out. That said there is a (small) possibility I could get flown out and sent back to Seattle at a moments notice. Could happen next week or next month or the month after, or even further out. Nobody knows.\n\nMy  question is this: if I were put on a flight back to Seattle, what are my transportation options to get into the city? Are the buses running? Is the light rail still running? Are cabs or uber still doing business? Are car rental companies srill renting cars? Do I hitch hike up I-5? Are liquor stores open? ðŸ™‚ I do not live in Seattle anymore but know it very well (lived there for 22 years). I have watched the whole pandemic unfold via news and hyper health vigilant text messages from family and friends back home. I don't really know what to expect. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance",
