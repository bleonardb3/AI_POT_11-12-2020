  "text": "I am just itching to get back out after quarantine is up, and I have seen some sources say mid-2020 state that is when frequency and travel times will increase and decrease respectively. Is this different because of COVID-19? I'd hate for this to be delayed yet again after those NIMBY stick-in-the-mud state politicians. I want better service! Maybe a day trip between Seattle and Portland will be possible via Cascades. Hopefully, this virus is finished soon so I can start riding the trains again!",
