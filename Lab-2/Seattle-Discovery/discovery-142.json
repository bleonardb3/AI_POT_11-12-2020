  "text": "Will be new to the area and looking for recommendations on apartments/townhomes in Seattle/Bellevue (more towards Bellevue as my employer is in the eastside) area that specifically have either a small storage room or garage area that I can store some weight equipment in.  It doesn't seem a common amenity, so asking here.\n\nI know a lot of higher end apartments (especially in Bellevue area) have gyms as part of the amenities, but I find having my own equipment readily available whenever I want just works better for me.  Prefer to work out alone and in as short a time as possible, so don't like \"traveling\" to gyms.  My home \"gym\" really is just free weights, kettlebell, a bench, barbell for deadlifting and snatches, dip bars, and a pullup bar.  I don't need much space to use them, but don't want to store them in my living area.\n\nAlso I use sites like Zillow, Hotpads, Apartments.com, but having \"garage\" as a filter selection isn't common or possible, so seeing if people have some personal recs.\n\nIn terms of \"vibe\", I think I'd do well in like Greenlake/Fremont/Wallingford area, but it'd be too hard of a commute.  Bellevue isn't really my thing with the glitzy strip mall vibe, but I can do it for a year or two.\n\nCritera include:\n\n- 1 bed / 1 bath \n- sq ft. 400-700 \n- max rent $1500-$2200ish \n- in unit laundry\n- relatively quiet\n- I have no pets\n- don't care so much about close to bars, but would like walkable to at least some restaurants and grocery.\n- don't care about apartment amenities like pool, jacuzzi, grill area, etc.  I would never use it.  The simpler the better.\n- garage or storage area big enough to store weights\n\nI would like to have posted this in /r/eastside, but the posts there are restricted to certain users.\n\nAny recs would be appreciated, thanks.",
