  "text": "I’m mainly posting this to see if anyone else is in my situation. I just moved to Seattle a week ago (weird timing but I had a job starting) and in order to get a zoned parking permit I need WA vehicle registration. In order to get WA vehicle registration, I need a WA license which I’m finding is impossible to get. The licensing office is closed and the most you can do online is a “pre-application”. When I called, customer service confirmed that the only way to obtain a new license is in the office, all of which are closed to my knowledge.\n\nIs anyone in a similar situation? Don’t have anywhere to park my car legally at the moment and would love to figure this out.",
