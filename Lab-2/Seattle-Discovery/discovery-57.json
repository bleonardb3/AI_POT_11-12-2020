  "text": "Hey guys I know these posts are probably getting annoying but considering ive had no luck getting through to the unemployment office this is really the only place i have available to ask.\nAnyway today I checked the site and had a notification to start a whole new application for some reason? \n\nI filled out an application 3 weeks ago now and they said I was ineligible because FL (my home state, i just moved here 2 months ago) reported to them that i did not work at all in the past 4 or 6 quarters, whatever it is. So I have absolutely no idea what to do, I have no idea why FL is reporting that I didn’t work in the past year and a half and I can’t get through to anyone to talk to to figure it out.\n\nSo should I try to fill out another application and just hope that this time FL reports my hours correctly?\n\nOh and another question: has anyone started getting the extra 600$ theyre supposed to receive from the stimulus package? Cause I think I should qualify for that simply because im laid off at the moment regardless of what Floridas saying about my past hours worked.",
