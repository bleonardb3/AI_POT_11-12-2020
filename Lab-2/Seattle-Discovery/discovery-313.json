  "text": "Hey guys so I just want to make sure i’m handling this right. So I filled out the original application a couple weeks ago and since then have filled out the weekly UI form, I actually just filled it out a couple minutes ago so the status shows as  “processing-web” right now, but before I did this weeks UI the status read as “ineligible-pending” and I don’t know if that means i’m just not eligible at all or if they’re still looking over some stuff? \nThe bottom line is I should definitely be eligible, I worked over the minimum 680 hours in the past 4 quarters and so I don’t really get why it’s not going through. i did just move here a couple months ago but on their site it says as long as youve worked and collected a wage in Washington you should qualify?\nDoesn’t help that I can’t even get through to any automated help let alone a real person when I call lol",
