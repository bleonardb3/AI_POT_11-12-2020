  "text": "Hi! I am new here so I hope I am posting in the right place. \n\nI am planning to move to Washington this Summer, I have a job in Kent and have been looking for apartments but I can't quite decide which neighborhood/area I should live in. I would love to hear some thoughts on: \n\n1. Commute (I would drive to Kent around 6:00 AM and likely drive home around 4:30-6:00 PM)\n\n2. The general feel of different neighborhoods\n\n3. Safety (relative to other areas in Seattle)\n\n4. Access to nature\n\n5. Access to downtown (Could I take a train or bus?)\n\nSome areas I was considering are: West Seattle, Queen Anne, South Lake Union, Bellevue, Columbia city, Tukwila, I'm open to other suggestions as well :)\n\nI am 22 years old (F) I'd like to live in an area with other young professionals. I love nature and the outdoors. My ideal spot would be somewhere that is a little bit quieter with good access to nature/hiking/places to run with downtown accessible by train or bus.\n\nThank you for reading my post.",
