  "text": "I grew up in a rural, anti-government, anti-authoritarian, second amendment community. I have a number of friends who by birth or by choice live in similar communities or embrace those ideals. I'm sick of hearing them downplay this pandemic.\n\nI'm sick of hearing about how people who stand six feet apart in line for groceries are choosing to participate in Soviet bread lines. I'm sick of hearing about how it's all a media plot to get ratings. I'm sick of hearing about how the Giant Asian Wasp is scarier than this \"flu.\"\n\nI have a history of respiratory infections. If I start to fall alseep, my oxygen levels drop far enough to set off alarms even when I'm healthy. I have a compromised immune system that fights against my own body by attacking the healthy parts as if they were foreign invaders. It's not nearly as bad as a lot of people have it, but it isn't nothing either.\n\nIt's now been 31 days since I packed up my office to come home. It's been 30 days since I've been outside my apartment for more than a short trip to the market a block away for supplies. It's physically painful for me to walk very far, so I have a bunch of electric vehicles that I normally ride. I haven't ridden my EUC and I've never ridden the OneWheel I recently bought because I can't risk falling and having to go to the ER.\n\nI'm actually OK with staying home. I have a great job that I can do from my apartment, so I'm in a way better place than a lot of people and I'm thankful for that. I could be doing a lot worse.\n\nBut I just can't abide the people who want to roll their eyes and insult those of us that are scared because we're at risk. Maybe some right-wingers are right and Darwinism should kill the old and the weak, but as one of the weak, I'd prefer it not and I'd prefer people not act like it's no big deal.",
