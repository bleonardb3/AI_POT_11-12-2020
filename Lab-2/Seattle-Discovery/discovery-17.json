  "text": "I'm working from home - and with these huge pollen counts, am stuck inside (seasonal allergies). Several weeks ago, traffic pretty much anywhere in Greater Seattle was a thing of the past - so few cars on the road, it was just red lights and curves that made you brake.\n\nMy wife works at a regional hospital and has been deemed essential. Today after coming home, she said traffic on the one hour round-trip drive was like normal - heavy, stop-and-go, etc.\n\nCan't confirm the traffic myself - so has anyone else seen/experienced this? If so, any theories why? People stir-crazy and going for a drive? Headed to the parks that are still open? Increase in essential workers? Have any types of businesses been permitted to reopen in the last couple of weeks?\n\nHonest question - thanks for any insights and theories you can share.",
