  "text": "So, my girlfriend and I have been recently searching to rent a house. We have found one in Wallingford that seems great, and the rental price is amazing as well (asking $2000/mo for a 2 Bed/1 Bath with what I would consider a large yard, on street parking only though). We reached out and their response gives me a bit of a sketchy vibe.\n\nOne: The only way to contact them was on the phone, or through showmetherent.com, and the name of the owner was a company name that doesn't show any results when google'd other than the listing on showmetherent.com. Already at this point I was a bit worried.\n\nTwo: When they responded to our contact through the website, there were 2 emails and 3 names. Our original contact was sent to (omitting real names here) name1@yahoo.com. Their response came from name2@gmail.com, and they signed of the email with name3. This gave me the most suspicion.\n\nThree: While the rent is low, their asking for an entire month of rent for the refundable security deposit, which seemed odd. I've never rented a home before, so maybe this is a normal thing to do.\n\nI've tried searching all three names and have come up with nothing which also concerns me a bit.\n\nWhat do you all think?",
