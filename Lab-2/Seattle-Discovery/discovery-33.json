  "text": "I’ve been applying for benefits since March 15th and have still not received a check/deposit.\n\nI understand fully the overhaul on the system as well and that they are going to back pay any claims, but I’ve done digging and found a few questions that raise some concerns of how to dispute/appeal. (Any helpful comments welcomed)\n\nIn the 1099 section is says the status is “Disqualified” with no reasoning on each valid claim I’ve submitted. My claim is still “active” but when I click the clicky labeled Disqualified it says I have to contact the offices to dispute.\n\nI’ve also been approved of standby (March 21st got the letter), but have now had to request standby again multiple times due to the 1099 disqualification.\n\nI’ve already sent an email (Monday) and am hoping to hear back.\n\nDoes this mean that either: \n\nA) my boss isn’t actually complying with the letters sent (or isn’t even responding back?)*\n\n(*: under the new rules I am definitely approved for benefits but I have this gut feeling he’s trying to not approve of it because he possibly doesn’t have the money to pay it back at the end of the year. Again this is just a gut feeling knowing how I’ve been given the runaround since I started almost two years ago.)\n\nB) the system is automatically kicking me these notices and they are working on getting it fixed.\n\nI understand the phones are overloaded and there is now a scheduled time to call in based on the last digit of your social security number, but being left in the dark with absolutely no guidance and my funds running lower (alongside my husbands job slowly shutting down) it’s getting a bit more hectic and scary (as well as slightly unnerving if I’m right in guessing my boss is doing this to cover his own ass. ((And I don’t want to approach him just yet about it because I know I’ll get fucked some way or another if I asked what the hell is going on)).\n\nThanks for the insight to anyone who can possibly give help for understanding what the hell is happening and how to alleviate this.\n\n(And yes, I just saw the news that unemployment just hit 6.6 million people today so it’s gonna be rough.)",
