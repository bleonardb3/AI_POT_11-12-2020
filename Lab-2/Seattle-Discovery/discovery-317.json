And yes, I agree it feels like Summer with a lot of people off work and kids out of school. But people are dying. Healthcare workers are risking their lives for us and this is how you repay them? I’m fortunate enough to be able to have a job. But so many people don’t and it’s not fair to them. Please go home and stay home until this is all over.",
