  "text": "Fresh 21-Year old here moving from South Florida to Seattle for my PhD Program. I'm stressed about everything but mainly commute & meeting people I guess. I found a place in Lake Forest Park (didn't put my deposit yet) and my School is in Queen Anne. What is the Morning rush hour on I-5 really like because right now it says my commute would be 20 minutes but that sounds unrealistic. Also What places should I generally avoid and what are the best places to get gelato, Jamaican food, and Southern food. This is gonna me my first time in the northwest and I'm used to Jamaica and Florida, Please help :').",
