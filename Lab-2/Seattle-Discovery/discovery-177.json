I saw some comments on living in Wallingford, Fremont, and East Lake as good options, but I thought it would be nice to hear what you guys have to say. I do want to stray away from the university district - I think I've had my share of undergrad experiences/ drunk weekends (that's what I heard that's like).\n\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated :)!",
