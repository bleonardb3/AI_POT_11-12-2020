  "text": "Channeling my frustration into something weirder. Yes, I sent this to them.\n\nDear Unemployment Insurance Offices,\nI must admit I feel foolish sending you this note when, alas, my last two sincere attempts at reconciliation have gone unanswered. But, despite your cold disavowal of my heart-sick pleas, here I am again, on bended knee, begging for even a small token of your attention. A letter of receipt. A pre-written form containing your condolences that you are not able to reply in turn. Anything. I fear that even this meager request will go unfulfilled, leaving my soul as empty and forlorn as my bank account. Since I doubt that you will be reading this at all, busy as you are with the thousands of penniless suitors clamoring for your attention, then I do not fear debasing myself by admitting that I have called upon you dozens of times only just today. Mostly my endeavors were met with the same chilly, soulless response that it seems all of your admirers received in kind; a rote, bland suggestion that you were otherwise occupied but that I should try again later. And try again I did. And again. And again. More than three score desperate attempts of mine to reach you, to hear your human voice were met with the same heart rending response. Twice or thrice I did actually manage a few rings! No bell has ever sounded sweeter that it might connect me to my hearts true desire, the one who may in my hour of strident need, act as a balm on my suffering and ease my troubled brain! Breathless I waited, grateful breath bated that I may at last hear the dulcet tones of your heavenly voice. Alas, and with great dismay, the peak of the rings ended not in the sweet succor of your presence, but in the agony of a hellish, demonic dial tone. As if the one I longed for so ardently had indeed answered my call....only to abandon it without even so much as a greeting. I write these words in vain, with no expectation of returned affection, but somehow my wretched hands will not stop reaching for whatever means might afford me some small comfort in this, the darkest of our days. I will wait forever, if i must. One last thing before I depart to spend the solitude of my day in a state of languishing ennui...not that I labor under the delusion that it will sway your cold, unmoving heart but simply because I wish you to know.....I am with child.\n\nUnwilling Yours.",
