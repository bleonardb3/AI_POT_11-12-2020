  "text": "\\*Note: The landlord posted two days notice to tenants in the building for inspection per RHA. \n\nI just tried to call our property management, Excel Properties, asking why they feel it is necessary to have two people enter the apartment and the subsequent units during a pandemic to perform an inspection. I called property management to voice my concerns about the risk for myself and the other tenants (not to mention the people entering the building) and was met with a rather argumentative and dismissive phone conversation with the owner. \n\nUnder normal circumstances, she's in her legal right to perform an inspection - but how about during these times? Is anyone else experiencing weird property management issues during this pandemic?",
