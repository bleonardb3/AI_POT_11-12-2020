Mods let me know if not and I can take down.\n\nAs a partner and sister of frontline physicians, I'm becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of PPE nationwide for our healthcare heroes. Instead of feeling useless, I'm collecting PPE to bring to our Chicago area hospitals.\n\nIf you have something to donate, let me know and I can coordinate with you and pick up so the effort is minimal for you! Also, let me know if any businesses you think may be able to help. I've reached out to nail salons and realtors in my area (West Loop) but will take any help we can get!\n\nMain supplies needed urgently:\n- surgical masks\n- N95 Masks\n- disposable gloves \n- boot covers\n- gowns\n- disposable face shields \n\n\nThank you! Stay safe! (And 6 feet apart!)",
