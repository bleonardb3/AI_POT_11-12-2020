  "text": "So my wife signed up for unemployment a few weeks ago and just now got her letter in the mail, but here's the deal. According to the letter she needs to certify on Mondays starting 4/6/2020 and that date passed because the letter didn't come in until the 11th. Also, the letter was mailed on the 30th. Anyone else having this issue?",
