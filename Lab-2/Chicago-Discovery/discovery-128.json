  "text": "I hired a roofer off of yelp a while ago, and the guy wanted half the money for a job up front. He said he couldn't take credit card, and I could do check or quickpay - Because I am an idiot, I sent via quickpay. Also being doubly an idiot, I sent him the full amount, not the half up front.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight after I paid him, he got super sketchy - hard to reach on the phone (yelp doesn't even have an address listed for him) , and delaying when he'd come to do the job. Then he started telling me he is going through a bankrupcy right now - won't do the job and I shouldn't bother pursuing him in court as i'll get pennies on the dollar back if I do. \n\nChase have refused to help, saying quickpay is the same as cash. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know so much of this is my fault because I was the idiot who paid someone up front without looking too much in to it.  Has anyone been through anything like this? Am I best just letting this go as a very painful and expensive lesson?",
