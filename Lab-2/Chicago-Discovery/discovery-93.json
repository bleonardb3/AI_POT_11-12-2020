  "text": "I got in touch with IDES today to check on the status of my claim, and they let me know that I will get a letter in the mail about when to certify and that it will take them minimum 1 week, more likely 2 weeks, to reprocess all the self-employed claims. You'll need to provide proof of income like taxes or 1099's at some point. Apply now, you'll get a letter telling you when to certify. Make sure to certify and at some point in the next few weeks IDES will have been able to reprocess all the self-employed/gig worker claims.\n\n\nSomeone can correct me if i'm wrong here, but the stimulus bill that was signed today provides $600/week for 4 months to all the unemployed, and it makes it so that all the folks that are self-employed are eligible for the normal unemployment which lasts something like 26 weeks (?) and i think maybe they extended that too an extra 13 weeks but I may be wrong on that front.",
