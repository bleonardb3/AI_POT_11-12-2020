  "text": "Hello!\n\nChicago has (to me) very surprisingly cheap real estate in the Wicker Park, Logan, even downtown etc. areas compared to NYC/SF, etc., such that owning a 2-3 bedroom and be downtown or in a Brooklyn-equivalent area in Chicago suddenly seems within reach given my current career (tech). 2-3 bedrooms for 4-700k just... don't exist in other cities with the cultural, architectural, public transit, and tech/finance vibrance that Chicago seems to share.\n\nWhat I missing? The taxes, specifically property, or any other gotchas to moving/living in CHI? Specifically given I'm from a coastal expensive city already, so I'm aware of the general COLA increases. I'd love an explanation in layman's terms. I'm aware the IL Pension is dramatically underfunded, and from various comments I've pieced together in here, home owning appears to be a downside in that environment? Just how bad is it?\n\nAlso, I work in tech - tech industry and general companies that support those jobs in Chicago, growing or not?\n\nThanks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I lived in upstate NY on the lake side for years, and was born in Minnesota, that style weather doesn't bother me much or at least I know what to expect.  \n\n\nEdit2 - super helpful, thanks!",
