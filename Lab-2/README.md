# Lab 2: Create a knowledge management system and develop a COVID-19 vulnerability index
## Introduction
In this lab you will create a knowledge management system (KMS), train the KMS to generate knowledge and analyze information to create a COVID-19 vulnerability index. IBM Watson Discovery will be used to develop and train the KMS.

## Objectives
The goal of this lab is to familiarize the user with the Watson Discovery service. Watson Discovery is an enterprise AI search technology that leverages machine learning, including natural language processing (NLP), to retrieve specific answers to your questions and analyze trends and relationships buried in enterprise data. By integrating a machine learning annotator from Watson Knowledge Studio (which we created and deployed in Lab 1), Watson Discovery can be trained on the language of your domain to perform customized NLP. The Watson Discovery service can be deployed on any cloud or on-premises environment.

After completing this lab, you will be able to perform the following exercises with Discovery:
1.	Create a Discovery collection
2.	Upload the documents
3.	Add the entity model from Knowledge Studio
4.	Perform custom entity extraction
5.	Retrieve the analyzed files using the Discovery API
6.	Calculate the COVID-19 vulnerability index
7.	Create a collection with a COVID-19 publication
8.	Perform Smart Document Understanding
9.	Create and run Natural Language Queries
10.	Improve accuracy with Relevancy Training
