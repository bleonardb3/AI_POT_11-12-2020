    "text": "Heyo!\n\nJust tore down a tree on our property in White Center and found some termites in the stump. He have seen termites in other stumps on the property and have never had issues but this one is too close to the house for comfort.\n\nHoping to see if anyone has any recommendations for a good local company who can come out and see if this is something we should be concerned about? I'd prefer to pay someone for their time since I assume anyone that comes out for free is going to try and give me the termite heebie geebies and sell me on their iron fortress protection plan..\n\nBeyond that, anyone know anything about the local termite scene? I did some research and it really doesn't seem like a common problem around here. Hard to even find much info about companies that offer termite control.\n\nThanks!",
