    "text": "TL;DR - anyone had success lobbying the Utilities and Transportation Commission to have their energy bill changed?\n\nHey all - not sure if there is a better place to post this question. We moved to Seattle in July and bought a house at that point. In February a PSE technician came out to do some work on our meter - he was there for about 30 seconds and came back and said he \"replaced a battery\" and we're all set. Sure enough, my next bill had a large spike in usage (accurate, I'm sure) and it seems like the meter had not been working and under-reporting my gas usage to the company. Looking back through records this has been a problem for a least a year and probably longer, well before I bought the house. PSE sent me an adjusted bill, estimating my energy usage since I bought the place in July and wants to charge me several hundred dollars more than what I was originally billed. I called in and talked with several people at PSE and worked my way (politely) up the food chain. My concern is that I dont think there is anyway for them to accurately bill me for my gas usage and their \"estimate\" is a pure guess. They can't use last years data - I didnt' live here. I was out of the house for many weeks during the adjusted bill period and set the thermostat to 55. In my mind, its their problem that the meter broke and to bill me for their mistake is just wrong. They can't do it accurately so they shouldnt do it at all.  I was given the phone number for the Utilities and Transportation Commission and told that my complaint would have to be filed with them because PSE is just following the rules that are set by them. \n\nMy questions are if anyone else has dealt with this and if anyone has had success dealing with Utilities and Transportation Commission. I honestly think their estimates are still conservative and in my favor, so I have half a mind to just pay it and be done with it. But I also think this its there mistake and I shouldn't be penalized for it.  Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!",
