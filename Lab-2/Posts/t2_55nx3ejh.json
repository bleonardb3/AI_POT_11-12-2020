{"text":"I'm a born and raised NYC chick who's been through 9/11 and everything else life has thrown our way. I felt that all of my struggles here would one day pay off. I thought that being a full time student with two jobs here would help me make it here.\n\nI cannot work during this crisis for health reasons. My landlord, who has known me and my family for years, will not budge. He either needs rent this month, or double rent next month. It's not that I won't do it, but I can't  and I'm scared.\n\nI saw all the other moving trucks in my little Queens neighborhood and thought they were stupid for panicking. Nah, i don't have that superiority complex anymore. Those people weren't scared,  they're just at their breaking point. It's not worth it being here anymore. We got no love from our landlords in this crisis. If NYC is home then why did our landlords make our home and war zone.\n\nI do hope one day I can come back, who knows. But i set up arrangements to leave with my entire family before the 1st of the month.","author_fullname":"t2_55nx3ejh","title":"What's a waitress to do?"}
