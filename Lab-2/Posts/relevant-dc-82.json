    "text": "Hey guys. I am moving to DC in July with a job working for the government. I want to know what neighborhoods in DC are mostly young millennials (Age 20-35)? I read a lot about DC being filled with young people who are creative and love travelling. Here are the factors I am using to choose a neighborhood:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Concentration of young people\n\n\\-Food options (Fast casual >>> fancy restaurants)\n\n\\-Vibrant nightlife close by\n\n\\-Good Date spots \n\n\\-Density\n\n\\-Access to Public Transportation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am likely going to live with roommates so quality renting options will be a factor too.
