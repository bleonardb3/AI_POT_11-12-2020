    "text": "Now that I have time to do whatever I want during this virus emergency, I want to take the time to ask a general question regarding both about internships and scholarships within the greater dc area. Are there any private or public sector scholarships for a person entering university but is an out of state online univ? I would like serious answers. Also are there any private or public sector internships for someone getting their bachelors in public health? any recommendations for a specific company/ department for the internships?",
