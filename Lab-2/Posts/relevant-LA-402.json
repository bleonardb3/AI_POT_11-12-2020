    "text": "Sister started working one month before the pandemic hit and became unemployed due to the virus;  it was her first job so she has limited overall work history. She filed for unemployment to get the PUA but the EDD portal says her \"Claim Balance\" is $0 due to lack of work earnings, I assume. I know she doesn't qualify for regular unemployment due to not enough earnings, but I've seen the CARES act eligibilities and it mentions limited work history as a qualification. Has anyone been in this situation that ACTUALLY only received the PUA ($600)?",
