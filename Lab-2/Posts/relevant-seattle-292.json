    "text": "Not all of us who work in healthcare are high paid doctors or nurses.  I work in healthcare, live in a small studio on cap hill, and have no local family/support network.  Thank you to those who do the 8 pm support yell for healthcare workers.  It means a lot.  This is a really scary time, and I'm probably not the only one in the area who works in healthcare, is scared and tired, and sometimes cries from the 8 pm yell because at least somebody gives a shit.  Thank you.\n\nOkay, back to my regular reddit account.  Wash your hands!",
