    "text": "I am currently receiving unemployment benefits. I was going to request for PEUC and one of the queries during the application asking if I  want to restart the claiming date with the query below:\n\n\"The last activity on your claim occurred the week ending Apr 18 2020. Claims restarted today will have a restart date of Apr 19 2020. Is this the week you wish to restart your claim? \"\n\nI am not sure what this is asking. This sounds strange to me as I am currently receiving the benefit and the period is not ending anytime soon (Sorry, maybe it is my Engish, I am not a native English speaker) so does this mean I should put the date when my current regular benefit period is over?  (Note: when I choose \"No\" to the query, I am then asked to specify a date when to restart.)",
