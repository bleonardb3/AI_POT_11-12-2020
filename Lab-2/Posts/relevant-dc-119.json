    "text": "This post might be perceived as insensitive, and to the extent that it is I apologize, but I think this is a fair concern. \n\nThere’s a man who sets up across the street from my home every night starting at about 6 PM, and intermittently yells at passerby and then later simply yells into the night when no one else is around. He’s probably 200 feet from my window and I can here him pretty good inside my place, so it’s pretty loud. From the brief interactions I have had with him when I have passed on the sidewalk, he is not particularly friendly. \n\nIs there anything I can do about this guy? I just don’t want him screaming outside my window late at night. Given how terribly this city has managed to help the homeless population and address the vagrancy issues in this city in general, I don’t feel that individuals like this would be anything the local PD would take the time to care about.",
