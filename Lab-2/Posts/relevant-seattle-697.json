I restarted my unemployment claim that I had filed earlier in the year, and did the first weekly filing this past Sunday.  As of 11 AM this morning, I still have not been paid, and my filing's status is listed as in the \"waiting week.\" Aren't these supposed to be waived, by order of the Governor?",
