{"text":"I signed up for unemployment when my job closed down on March 16th, we were advised to sign up the next day and I did. I got through after 2 days of calling and my claim was processed. I got the first payment direct deposit the following week, but after that I havent recieved anything even though I've been certifying for benefits the past two sundays. It hasn't showed a release date, I've Sent them messages and have been calling non stop to no avail, I'm just wondering if anyone else is in this boat? The second time I certified it asked me a few questions about my job and I answered honestly even though I answered those same questions when I got someone on the phone when I first filed my claim. I got a letter saying I qualified, no rejection letter, when I log on it shows I certified and the amount I'm supposed to get but no release date and only shows the waiting week and first payment they sent.","author_fullname":"t2_6538ltgj","title":"Unemployment Question (alittle different from the usual)"}
