{"text":"So here's the deal. I'm a college student. I'm working for a transportation company as dispatch/office manager. My boss is an exploitative shitstain and classifies me as an \"independent contractor\" (which I'm technically not) ie i file a 1099. Given the concerns lately around travel being that tourists made up 90% of our business, it's slowed down dramatically. I'm sure a full nyc lockdown is coming sooner or later which would mean i'd be let go. Being that I'm classified under 1099, I would not be eligible for unemployment. If lockdown does indeed happen, wouldn't be able to find a job either. Meanwhile I have to pay my own tuition--with no avenue of income for the near future. What in the world am I supposed to do?","author_fullname":"t2_xg5n7","title":"Going to probably lose my job. Pretty terrified, have no idea what to do"}
