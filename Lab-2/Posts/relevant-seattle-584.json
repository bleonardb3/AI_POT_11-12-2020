    "text": "I am in South Seattle. Minutes ago (~3:15 p.m.), a jet flew lower than I’ve experienced any aircraft flying before. Loud, abrupt, and a bit startling.\n\nI didn’t see it. The aircraft was out of sight by the time I stepped outside. It drowned out my work call and sent the neighborhood dogs barking, mine included.\n\nAnyone else experience this? Is this abnormal?",
