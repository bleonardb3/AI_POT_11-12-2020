    "text": "Hi everyone, I’m trying to find a good place to work from my car in the dmv. I’m staying home during the week in dc but I would like to find a place I can pull off to work on my computer. \n\nI tried Gravelly Point but it’s closed. \n\nIm abiding by social distancing/quarantining during the week but getting some fresh air( while being smart  about it) is important to keeping my mental health in tact. Open to any suggestions",
