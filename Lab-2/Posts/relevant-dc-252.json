    "text": "Crossposted at /r/bikedc.\n\nI was riding home from a bike ride today when I came really close to getting hit by a cop. I was entering the intersection on New Hampshire heading northeast at R St, I had green mind you, when a cop who was waiting at the red light on R st turned on their lights only(no siren) and proceeded to floor it into the intersection and come within a foot or two of slamming into me. He yelled at me to \"Keep my head up\" and then proceeded to clear the intersection and turn his lights back off and repeat the same process at the red at R and 18. I'm unsure what to do with this...this was clearly a situation where he was bored at the light and was using police privilege to clear the lights. When I got home and told my partner that I wanted to call 911 about it, my partner said I'm being stupid and this is a great way to make enemies with the police, which sadly is true. But on the other hand I almost got sent to the hospital by a police officer who was bored at a red light. Unsure what to do about this, and ironically that was by far the closest I've ever gotten to being injured while riding by a vehicle. Thought I'd query r/washingtondc if anyone has input on how to approach this.",
