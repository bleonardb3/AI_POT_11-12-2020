    "text": "Hey, new resident.  After I got my license the DC BOE mailed me my voter registration card.  Now, in the last 3 months, they've mailed me new ones on 3 occasions.  Only once was because they moved our voting location.  What's up?  Am I supposed to do something like mail them something back?",
