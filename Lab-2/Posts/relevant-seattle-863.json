    "text": "My mother owns a hair salon that is shut down here in Washington. We have an employee who cleans the salon once a week.\n\nWe were expecting them to work during this time but they have let us know they are wanting to stay home at this time to comply with the stay at home order. Nobody has been in the building (aside from my mom) and supplies and everything are available for their safety if they want them. Because their position is still available to be worked, but they are refusing to come in, do we still owe them sick pay at this time? We have a different person coming in to clean at this time since they have chosen to not work.",
