    "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI live in DC but have been stuck in quarantine in New England. I am thinking of driving back to the city using my parents car, but am wondering if anyone has tips about parking. My building has a few spots but they are all rented out right now. I don’t think I can sign up for a Residential Parking Pass, since the car won’t have DC plates. I read online that some wards have unrestricted parking, but I can’t find any information about where those would be. Any idea where I could find that information?\n\nThank you for your help!",
