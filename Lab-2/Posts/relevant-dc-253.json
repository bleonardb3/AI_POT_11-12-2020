I usually keep my car in a garage at work but without work, I can't afford to leave it there anymore and I am wondering what the new guidance is as far as paying for metered parking but more so if I am allowed to leave it parked in the streets, including if it's safe or wise to do so giving a spike in crime around the city.\n\nEdit: also, my damn covid-19 test came back today - NEGATIVE!!! Yayyyy!! I was having ALL of the symptoms so it's been a crappy week.",
