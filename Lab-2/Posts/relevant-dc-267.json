I believe in public transport as a social issue and have no problem using it.  \n\nBut now I'm looking down the lens of negotiating with a contractor for a job located in the Navy Yard.  Due to Covid changes in train and bus times, I can't accurately predict my commute times on the WMATA app.  But I can predict the cost.  \n\nThe best I can tell is about 1.25 hours one way, and a total annual cost of $4500.  \n\nIs this a lot?  Is this an average commute for someone in the outlying areas?  Should I expect the contractor to understand this as a factor in their offer?\n\nThanks in advance.",
