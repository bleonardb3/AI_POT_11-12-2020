    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm scheduled to be working in DC. I've been there several times but this time I'm actually staying there. Looking for pointers I can't find online.\n\nIt appears the whole White House area is premium demand zone for street parking. I believe this means it's a 2 hour limit between 7am-10pm, correct? I believe this also means you can't just park and refill with coins or ParkMobile throughout the day... and you have to move to a different zone?\n\nThe centerpoint of where I'll be is 15st NW and Ist NW. If anyone has a preferred parking spot that can do multi-day overnight parking (at a reasonable rate) and accommodates a Jeep Grand Cherokee, please let me know. I've been scouring ParkHero but its hard to compare them there. I definitely need to be able to go to the vehicle during business hours and retrieve things. \n\nWhat's the COVID-19 situation there? Are all restaurants in DC shutdown for dine-in and only doing take-out?",
