    "text": "Hello,\nI applied for unemployment and was approved (4 weeks ago) on Standby. Since then, I have not seen a dime in my bank and there are no rows or lines saying processing/denied/paid to each of the week I file my weekly claim. This Sunday, the PUA and PEUC application pops up and I filed for both. Turns out, the PUA is for those who are self-employed, contractors,...etc. I was approved and now I have an active PUA claim and my status is ‘paid’. My question here is am I in trouble for receiving this money because I’m not self-employed or is a contractor. But the ESD website said the PUA also applies to those who workplace is closed because of the pandemic (this applies to me). I don’t know if I will be in trouble for have to return the money.",
