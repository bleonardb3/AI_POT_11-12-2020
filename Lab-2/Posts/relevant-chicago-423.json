    "text": "I made an unemployment claim early last week and they have not contacted me at all - no emails, no phone calls, nothing. Due to an error on my part I should not have filed the claim. However it's now impossible to talk to anyone at IDES, since every time you call you have to sit through almost 4min of the automated system talking before you're able to push a number to make a choice, and right after you make a choice it just says \"we're unable to take your call at this time\" and then it hangs up. There is literally no way to talk to a human, I've been calling for 6 days.\n\nThe contact form on their website is also a dead link. I emailed the general contact email of the Lt. Gov. office and tweeted at the IDES Twitter account (even though, looking at their timeline, they don't interact with anyone, just post their own stuff), but that's all I can find to do. I don't want to get in trouble for having a claim open when I shouldn't have one, so any ideas?",
