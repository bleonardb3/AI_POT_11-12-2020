{"text":"Hello, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI filed for UI on 3/27 via the web and submit everything just fine. \n\nI got a message in my inbox from them saying:\n\n*We have received the claim you recently filed on our website. However, you need to speak to an agent to complete it as soon as possible.*\n\n*To do this, please call our Telephone Claims Center toll free at 888-209-8124. Select your language, then press 9 for the Main Menu. At the Main Menu, press 2 - \"To complete your claim...\" Please follow the instructions and wait on the line until a representative is available to help you.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever on the main page it says: \n\n**Please do not call if you already have a UI claim; it will only make it difficult for others to reach an agent.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Do I need to call this number, or am I ok?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks","author_fullname":"t2_56c8qiio","title":"Unemployment Insurance Question"}
