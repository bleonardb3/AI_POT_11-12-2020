    "text": "I'm applying/filling out the unemployment forms online.  However, furlough/or something like temp layoff isn't an option for reason for separation.  Would it be laid off even though this is for a minimum of 6 weeks?  Or is there a completely different website to file for CV19 reasons that I'm not finding on google?\n\nThank you - hang in there everyone!",
