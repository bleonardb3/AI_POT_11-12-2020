    "text": "Recently accepted a job offer for Amazon to work at HQ2. Starting remote cause of coronavirus but I'll have to commute down to Crystal City/Arlington, VA eventually. \n\nI currently live in Anne Arundel county maryland, and I'm used to a 7 minute commute to the Fort up here. How fucked am I? What commute times can I reasonably expect and how can I mitigate the suck?\n\nWith absolutely no traffic on the roads, google maps is telling me the drive down to Crystal City is 35 mins. Should I try to ride the metro? Just drive? Looking for any advice",
