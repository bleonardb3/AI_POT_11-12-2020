    "text": "I’m sure you are sick of the “moving to dc what neighborhood should I look at” posts, but I want to know what neighborhoods you’d recommend for commuting to Georgetown Law center which is across the street from the FBI field office building? Although I’ve been to D.C. before, I wasn’t able to visit with the intention of moving due to Covid, so I could use some help . I know most students live in NOMA which I’m not too excited about (if you live there and love it tell me why I’m wrong). I don’t mind commuting approximately 30 minutes each way. I’d prefer taking the metro but I’m accustomed to taking the bus as well. From researching I think Adams Morgan seems nice and I’m interested in Woodley Park bc it has a metro stop and is near Adams Morgan and the park. I’m moving with my significant other and we’d prefer a 1BR but are ok with a studio. We have money saved and she has a decent job so we can afford around  $2000 a month for rent but would prefer it closer to 2000 or under.\n\nEdit: S/O will be working near DuPont circle. And edited for clarity",
