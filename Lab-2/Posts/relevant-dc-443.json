    "text": "I had to move last week as my lease ended (bad timing), so I recently cleaned out my closet. I’ve got about 5 trash bags full of men’s clothing (mostly medium sized shirts and 30/32ish sized pants). Goodwill is closed and not accepting donations. I have to go in to work this week so I can’t hit Salvation Army and they are only open during business hours. Where can I drop off a bunch of gently used clothes so they don’t go to waste?\n\nI also have a wood TV stand and small side board to get rid of if anyone is interested.",
