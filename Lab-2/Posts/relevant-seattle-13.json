    "text": "I have called every day, and the farthest I have gotten is the option to choose a scheduled callback that never came. I have read everything on the website including the new directives, so I am sure I am eligible, but I still have no clue what to do since I am still not getting any money. Maybe someone here can shed some light. \n\nSituation:\n\nMoved to Washington for work, and started 02/14 full time (40 hours). \n\nReduced hours the week of 03/22-03/28 (32 hours) due to COVID...... the week of 03/29-04/04 (8 hours)...... the week of 04/05-04/11 (5 hours).... week of 04/12-04/18 (13 hours).... week of 04/19-04/25 (0 hours).\n\nInitial claimant filing 04/05. Status Completed/ Ineligible. Requested standby (approved). Weekly benefit amount = $0. Decision reason- have not worked 680 hours including alternative base year.\n\nThree weekly claims have been filed. Status - Invalid.\n\nFiled a PUAC claim 04/18. Status Completed (instantly). No decision, no change to my account, no email or physical mail piece, nothing. I read that the claims you already submitted were supposed to transfer over, but mine did not. \n\nExtra information:\n\nSince the first initial claimant filing (04/05), I have had an alert in my portal to Apply for Benefits. I ignored it, originally thinking that the PUAC (04/18) would fix my account, but when it did not I clicked apply, which was labeled Subsequent claim filing (04/23). I was thinking maybe it was a way to restart my claim after the rule change without losing my three submitted claims. I was wrong. All it did was ask the same questions and disqualify me again. As a result, on my account I now have a \"Manage my active UI claim\" which is the original filing and \"View my expired UI claim\" which is the new one. The new (expired) claim is asking me to file weekly claims, but I do not see the point in that since I am already filing with the original (active) claim. I do not know what that extra claim will do. I also did not request standby on the second application, because the website said that this requirement was dismissed, and I filed a week earlier so my inactive (expired) claim will have 4 instead of 3 filings. \n\nOnce I applied for UI the second time, I received another Alert for Apply for Benefits. So I assume, applying more than once does not do anything. \n\nTLDR- Hours have been reduced for a month. Worker has less than 680 hours. Applied for UI. Ineligible. Filed 3 weekly claims. Applied for PUAC. Nothing changed. Applied again for UI. Ineligible.",
