    "text": "I tried asking somewhere else and got downvoted immediately. I don't know if it's because you aren't supposed to ask questions like that or if people just like to kick those who are down. \n\n\nI moved here in December from a nearby city in WA, so I have the normal Washington insurance I think it's CHPW? I don't have extra cash to pay for a counselor that is off my insurance currently, unfortunately.\n\n\n\nI am /not/ trying to leave my house either to clarify, social distancing is important.",
