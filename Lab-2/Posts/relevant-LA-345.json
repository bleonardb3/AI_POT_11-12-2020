    "text": "Has anyone else gotten disqualified for their unemployment? My work is closed down until after the quarantine so I’m not sure if because I’m not “fired” I didn’t qualify? Or maybe because I was supposed to be “able to work” and didn’t? Just freaking out a bit because I need the money (obviously) and can’t get a hold of anyone from EDD (of course). Any information or tips would be helpful. Thank you.",
