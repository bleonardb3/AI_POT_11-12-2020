{"text":"Hi, would love if someone could help me out a bit as I feel very much in limbo with all of this. I'll try to be as transparent as possible.   \n\n\nSo I started my bartender job in 2018, from Jan - Nov.   \nFrom Nov 2018 - Dec 2019 I was not working.   \nI started again at the same place in Jan 2020 and became unemployed in mid March due to COVID19.   \n\n\nI applied for UI once we closed and finally got through to someone on Thur 04/02. The guy on the phone went through some basic questions, asked me if I wanted my taxes taken out of the payments, and before I could even ask if I was approved or how much I'm eligible to get, he had transferred me over to an automated message explaining more about UI. Seemed like he was in a rush.   \n\n\nI filed a claim on the Sunday for all previous weeks. A few days went by and my status is still 'pending'. Claim amount: $0.00. Effective days remaining: 104.  \n\n\nI filed again this Sunday. Still pending, still $0.00. Effective days 98.  \n\n\nI also filed for PUA today as recommended by someone, as I'm still pending. (I've seen mixed opinions on this so not sure if it was the right move now) It said I'm 'eligible' but I guess I still have to wait for approval. \n\nI know there is a backlog and a lot of people are left with 'pending status' but I'm not sure if I will be approved at all due to not working in 2019. Will they be able look at my quarters from 2018 at all? Should I be expecting a letter of denial? If I can't get UI will I be able to get PUA?   \n\n\nVery confused and stressed over all of this as I don't want to be left with nothing. And if that's the case I'd rather know sooner than later so I can plan accordingly.   \n\n\nAny help/advice/info is greatly appreciated!","author_fullname":"t2_5q0spppj","title":"Unemployment - UI/PUA Help Please"}
