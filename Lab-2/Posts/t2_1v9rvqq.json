{"text":"This is my first time ever claiming unemployment. I claimed both this and last week, is there a number to call so I can ask whats going on? I know it’s probably because of the massive amounts of people applying but I just want to double check, I just thought that the 7 day fee was waived and even so, its been more than 7 days. I’ve  checked my payment history and its still at 0.00 and pending. If anyone knows a number that I can contact please send it my way","author_fullname":"t2_1v9rvqq","title":"I applied for unemployment benefits on the week of 03/23, still have absolutely no money."}
