    "text": "Apologies in advance is this is asked all the time. I did a search to see if a similar question had been asked and it didn't appear that it had recently (but Reddit search is not the greatest).\n\nI just recently received a job offer from one of the Federal agencies in DC that would require a relocation. We currently live in Oregon and are seriously considering the relocation as the job would be extremely difficult to turn down. I am turning to y'all on this subreddit for some advice as we mull over a likely move.\n\nWhich suburbs would you recommend for a family in their mid-30s with a pre-k aged kid? Again, we are moving from Oregon is that influences the decision. Decent schools is ideal for when our kid is school-aged. She will likely be heading into work with me until then to take advantage of the day care on-site. Close to Metro is also ideal as that will be my primary way of getting to work.\n\nSecond question is who are good real estate agencies to check out in town and (maybe more importantly) who should we avoid? We, obviously, we be looking for someone with a good knowledge of the various surrounding cities.\n\nLastly, I have been to DC several times but my wife has never been and is, rightly so, a bit anxious about agreeing to move somewhere sight-unseen. Is there any info or reassurances you could give me to pass along to her?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: to add some info that came up in comments it would be a telecommute for a while and we would have plenty of to come out and explore areas and look at houses before buying. A stipulation of the offer is that we do relocate out there when we are able. What we are looking for is narrowing the areas to look at based on: $650k house budget (could go a bit above if needed), 45min (or so) train ride, decent schools/toddler friendly. Destination metro station is Smithsonian. Thanks again!",
