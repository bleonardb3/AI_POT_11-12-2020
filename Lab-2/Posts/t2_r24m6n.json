{"text":"My girlfriend is trying to apply for Unemployment Benefits and has completed the form online, but it gives a number to call in order to complete the claim. Every time she's called the number she puts in her info and it says \"now we'll transfer you to an operator who can complete your claim\" and then immediately hangs up. It's all automated so I'm not really sure how to get through so her claim will be completed. Does anyone know what we can do?","author_fullname":"t2_r24m6n","title":"Unemployment troubleshooting?"}
