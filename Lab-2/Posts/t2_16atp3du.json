{"text":"I filed on April 1st and never received a number to call, claim is still pending even though I claimed the $0 benefits for the first week. Am I supposed to call a number? Everybody is talking about not being able to get through on the line but I’ve never even had a number to call so I’m just a tad confused by all of this. I know the American system isn’t exactly as streamlined as possible but I’m really left in the dark here wondering what to do. \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated!
