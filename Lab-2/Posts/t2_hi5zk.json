{"text":"I filed for unemployment 2 weeks ago. It said I had to call in to complete. I know a couple of days ago they rolled out the new system. Its Sunday and I still have not been contacted. Also when I log into the NYGOV portal to check my unemployment claim there is nothing there anymore. I just get the page about filing for some tax form. Did anybody else experience this? Should I refile my claim?","author_fullname":"t2_hi5zk","title":"Unemployment claim is now gone?"}
