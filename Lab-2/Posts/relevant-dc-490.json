    "text": "Hi all, sorry if this is sort of a no brainer or not the right place for this kind of post. S o, I currently live in a place in the city with my mom, but am looking to move in with a few friends. My future roomies are eyeing a few places that are in Silver Spring/Hyattsville because (of course) it's cheaper since it's not DC proper. If I took a place in Silver Spring, would I end up losing my residency in DC? I go to college here and my tuition would for sure take a hit if so, so was anxious for an answer.",
