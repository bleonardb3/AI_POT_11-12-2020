{"text":"I filed my claim online, and then it says you have to call: 888-209-8124 to complete your claim. It takes around 50 tries to get through (One time I got through on the 3rd try, one time on try 120), then you speak to a robot, put in your information (Social, password, press a bunch of numbers etc) and then the robot... hangs up on you. HE JUST HANGS UP ON YOU AND TELLS YOU TO CALL BACK. And repeat.\n\nDOES ANYONE HAVE A SOLUTION TO THIS?\n\nAt this rate I feel like im just not going to be able to get unemployment. Everyone I know who's had to call has not been able to finish their claim and I just don't know what to do. \n\nJust wondering if anyone in r/nyc has any tips because im going fucking mad.","author_fullname":"t2_bnukf","title":"Has anyone been able to get through the unemployment phone number?"}
