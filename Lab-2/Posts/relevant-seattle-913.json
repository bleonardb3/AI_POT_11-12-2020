    "text": "Since I collect trash alone I don't think it's a big deal.  Also I don't really have a place of my own right now. That's why I'm trying to save up money. this whole thing was bad timing.  I know it's bad timing for everybody but it's really bad if you don't have a place to live.   I have my own car and its a station wagon.\n\nBasically my job is I just collect trash for different communities that opt for the service.  Some people can't take their trash out and most of the places I do it for have big compactors they use.  my employer sent me an email saying we are on a list of essential services but I still don't know.",
