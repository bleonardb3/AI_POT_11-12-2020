    "text": "So Iâ€™ve recently purchased a used car from a private seller in MD, and when I bought it he just put the plates of my old car onto it and I just had to go to the DMV to register it. But the DMV actually is closed until the end of April and I think I need to go in person to register it, since they need to see title etc. is it legal to drive around like normal until the DMV reopens?",
