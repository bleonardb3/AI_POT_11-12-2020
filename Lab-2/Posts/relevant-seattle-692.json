    "text": "My company did a forced 20% hour/salary reduction and told us we could apply for partial unemployment. I just did a few days ago. It looks like I will still make too much (according to n[https://esdorchardstorage.blob.core.windows.net/esdwa/Default/ESDWAGOV/Forms-and-Publications/ESD-earnings-deduction-chart.pdf](https://esdorchardstorage.blob.core.windows.net/esdwa/Default/ESDWAGOV/Forms-and-Publications/ESD-earnings-deduction-chart.pdf) ) to receive benefits each week. I wonder if I keep filing though, will I be eligible for the $600 stimulus check? Grateful to still have a job, but the 20% cut is a lot of money lost, and did I mention I live in Seattle? Its stupid expensive here. \n\nThanks for any guidance!",
