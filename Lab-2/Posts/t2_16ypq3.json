{"text":"I'm not alone here, I'm one of the people who completed my claim online but to have it finalized, I have to call in to have it processed. I've called thousands of times since last week and have yet to get through to a single person.\n\nEven the new \"call back\" system just disconnects me after I've spent 5 minutes going through a menu and giving my tax information. \n\nFuck Cuomo, Fuck DeBlasio, literally every other company and small business has a simple call back or waiting system. This influx should have been anticipated months ago. \n\nMy friends who have successfully filed have no word on the federal add on of $600 either. What the fuck, America? This is despicable. \n\nYour bail outs saved banks, huge corporations, but you can't even get your shit together to provide us a basic unemployment benefit phone line? How are we supposed to pay our bills, support families, let alone rent?","author_fullname":"t2_16ypq3","title":"NYC Unemployment Sign-Up is an Absolute Joke"}
