    "text": "I was accepted to be a congressional intern under my congressman. My University also has funding for students taking internships throughout the country like this, but I need to know where the best place to live for the summer would be before I officially submit out the form. Do any of you locals or experienced employees/interns in DC have any tips?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings that matter most to me about the housing:\n\n1. Cost.  You know, the whole broke college student vibe.\n2. I don't really want to live in a \"dorm-like\" fashion this summer as I'll be going right back to that in the fall, but if that's a significantly cheaper option than everything else, then I'm down to do it.",
