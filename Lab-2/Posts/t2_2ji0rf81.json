{"text":"I may have to find a part-time job after this whole mess. I wanted to work at a restaurant, but I feel like the tips would be low because people would still be a little reluctant to eat out. Ideally I would like to make $200-400 for about 16-20 hours a week as side income.\n\nany advice and thoughts would be greatly appreciated!","author_fullname":"t2_2ji0rf81","title":"After businesses open, where do you guys think are some decent and safe part-time jobs?"}
