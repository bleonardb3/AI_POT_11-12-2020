    "text": "So here's my situation. I initially applied for unemployment on March 15, and when I got the decision it showed that ineligible for 0 dollars. Initially I wasn't so concerned because it showed up as \"ineligible-pending\", which I thought was them reviewing my application. Granted, I moved here 10 months ago from New Jersey so when they asked if I worked in a different state in the last 18 months, I said yes. Im starting to get worried cause perhaps they're in the process of verifying my employment in New Jersey, but I am almost certain they're not receiving calls right now in their offices (Rutgers University). My claim has been in \"adjudication\" for 5 weeks now, where I read in the FAQs that it should take only 3 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to think I should redo my application again but I don't know if that's even allowed, and calling the unemployment office has been soul-draining so far. I am also considering filing for unemployment in my previous state, and I just wanted to verify if that is possible and okay?",
