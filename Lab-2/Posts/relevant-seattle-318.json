    "text": "I live in Canada , but my best friend works for another friend in a small 3 person business in Seattle . He’s had to lay my friend off and wants to submit a record of employment for her so she can collect EI. Unfortunately, there’s nothing clear that I can find as per instructions and  google seems to only want to show me Canadian information on this subject. No one has actually been able to even get put on hold for the normal places where you would call in the department of Labor or any local Seattle office and he’s never had to do this before and my friend is running out of time and money. I want to give her something that explained how to create the document  and where to submit it. They are both really overwhelmed right now and don’t know what they should be doing. Any guidance I can send them would help.",
