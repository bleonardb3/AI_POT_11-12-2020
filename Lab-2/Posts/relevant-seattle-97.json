I’ve been keeping a weekly to-do list and it’s been nice to check things off during the week. I live in Seattle and after losing my job last month due to the coronavirus effecting the industry I worked in, I’ve felt a bit lost in the mix of staying at home and looking for work while keeping it together.",
