{"text":"I was unemployed for a while in 2019 and maxed out my unemployment benefits then. I started a new job at the beginning of March but got laid off yesterday because of the pandemic. \n\nNow I can't file online because it says I already have a valid claim on file, and whenever I try calling the automated system hangs up on me when I put my info in. I know normally I wouldn't be eligible but I figure I should be now due to the current situation. I've tried a dozen different options and can't get a person on the phone no matter what. Does anyone know what I can do??","author_fullname":"t2_2gx2i3d","title":"Not sure how to file for unemployment? Weird situation"}
