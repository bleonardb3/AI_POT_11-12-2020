{"text":"Last Tuesday I filed for unemployment and I entered my bank info for direct deposit. I said I would get a test deposit in five days but I haven't received it.\n\nAnd today I sign in to claim my weekly benefits, and it is asking if my deposits were 'verified'. Im not sure i fi should re-enter the bank info or not?\n\nAnybody else gone through this?\n\n[see here](https://i.imgur.com/JTLhzei.png)","author_fullname":"t2_36herj8t","title":"Unemployment direct deposit"}
