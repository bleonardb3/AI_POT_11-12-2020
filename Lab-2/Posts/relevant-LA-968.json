    "text": "Hi there fellow Angelenos!\n\nIâ€™m part of a group for a market research class at Cal State Northridge. Weâ€™ve been tasked with developing and administering a survey as a project for the class and we would like your help!\n\nThe survey is about deli sandwiches and your overall dining out habits (sorry to do this during a time when weâ€™re not really leaving the house, but deadlines are deadlines unfortunately ðŸ˜”). The survey should take about 5 minutes to complete. \n\nIf you have a few minutes and are willing to help out some college students, please click the link below. Thank you for your help!\n\n[Deli Sandwich Survey](Https://forms.gle/GQY9NYpHuLEjbbWY9)",
