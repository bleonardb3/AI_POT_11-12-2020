However, I can't make heads of tails of this now, and am wondering if there's some guide somewhere someone has already put together.\n\nIndependent contractors who would normally not get unemployment are granted some help from the PUA and that's being administered through WA State's unemployment assistance office.\n\nAnyone have a clear guide to navigating this?",
