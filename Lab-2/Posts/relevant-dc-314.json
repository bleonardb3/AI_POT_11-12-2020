    "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI hope everyone is being safe during these times. I accepted a job in DC and I am looking to move around June. I previously considered Arlington but I decided that it might be better to live on the side of the Potomac where I work. I will be working downtown by the way! My MAX budget is $1500 but realistically I would like to be around $1350 because I also have a car (unless you have advice on how to avoid these astronomical parking fees like residential zone parking etc. ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜ª). With this budget in mind Iâ€™ve found a few places that Iâ€™m interested in: \n\nRhode Island Row Apartments- Iâ€™ve seen some threads about the area but I was wondering if anyone else could provide any experience with it? Safety? Iâ€™m a 23 y/o female \n\nAVA NoMa - Iâ€™ve also seen some conflicting info about NoMa \n\nAVA H street \n\nThe Edison at Union Market\n\nI value being by the metro and some walkability! I think as long as I am close to a grocery store Iâ€™m okay. I guess I could always Uber to bars or metro or something of that nature! \n\nThank you!",
