    "text": "I know this sub isn’t really meant for this, but I’ve been trying to get in contact with IDES for nearly two weeks now, and I just can’t get through. \n\nI moved to Chicago in August to start my new job and was laid off last month due to the virus. I applied for UI right away and my application went through, but I qualified for $0 since I hadn’t made enough outside the base period. \n\nNow that it’s April and the start of a new quarter, I’ve made enough to actually qualify. But when I try to submit a new application, I get an error message. \n\nIf I certify, will I get the new benefits? Or do I need to try harder to contact IDES? Again, sorry to spam this sub with this, but I can’t get in touch with anyone at the offices.",
