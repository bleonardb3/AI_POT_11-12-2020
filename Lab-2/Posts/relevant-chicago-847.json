    "text": "I can't find an answer online and the phones are busy. My employer wants me to come in for 10-20 hours per week after I just sat at home not working for the past 7 days. That's good news, but the income would be roughly the same as me getting unemployment insurance. So...if there was a certain amount of hours I could work while also getting unemployment insurance, I would hopefully try and do that.",
