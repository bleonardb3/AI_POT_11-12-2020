    "text": "I can't find a concrete answer but this is what I have found through some research but would love for someone who has experience with this to give me an answer. If a car is older than 8 years old, \"Vehicles more than 8 model years old shall not be required to complete a successful inspection required under Section 3-308.\" Can I just show up to the DMV with the salvage certificate and get the vehicle registered because the vehicle is older than 8 years? I'm sure someone here has registered a salvage title car that was older than 8 years.",
