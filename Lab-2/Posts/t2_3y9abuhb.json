{"text":"So I filed for unemployment over 3 weeks ago and it still says pending status and I have not heard anything about the amount. My three other coworkers filed on the same day and theirs all went through. My mom and I canâ€™t get through to anyone but the situation is getting scary. How much longer would waiting be considered normal. Also do part time workers get the additional $600? \nThanks.","author_fullname":"t2_3y9abuhb","title":"Unemployment question"}
