    "text": "Hi I read the sidebar and it wasn't that helpful. I am wondering which neighborhood would be a better fit for me. I plan to move to Seattle in a couple of months. I've been mainly looking for places in Capitol hill since it seems like that's where all the young people and transplants are. I'm 25 and single and would like to meet new people my age. I want to live close to good coffee, music venues and bars. I will have a car and I don't mind driving but I would prefer if things were still within walking distance. I hear Ballard has a nice bar scene. I'm not into clubbing, I think I would enjoy something more like a dive bar. I really enjoy going to alt/indie music shows. I like to shop at fashion boutiques and niche stores. I'm not too concerned about the work commute. I would suck it up and deal with it if traffic turns out to be hectic. I'm used to traffic anyways. I am more concerned about the social aspects of the neighborhood. Would I regret moving to Ballard and not Capitol hill if my main goal is to be around people my age?",
