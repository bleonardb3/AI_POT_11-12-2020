    "text": "Hey guys, I applied for unemployment since March 14th and all of my decisions are pending, \"waiting for further information to determine eligibility\" from claims I filed.  Also, I tried March 22nd to request standby because my job recommended it, and was declined.  I appealed and have not heard a peep from them at all.  I do also try calling the office everyday, every hour... and nothing.  \n\nMy question is, is anyone in my same boat and/or figured a way around this?",
