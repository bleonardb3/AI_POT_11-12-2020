{"text":"I have an unfortunate situation and a highly unusual one. I need to find a place to rent ASAP. It has to be an apartment, it can't be a share. \n\nThe problem is that I graduated and then did not have stable income, so (1) my tax documents before last year don't help me. After that I have been working abroad since partway through last year (so (2) my tax documents for last year don't help me that much) and to top it off I (3) don't have anything (pay stubs, direct deposits to a US or foreign bank) that are going to want to be seen. For reasons I'd rather not go into, I have an extremely limited amount of time to find a place and it has to be in the NY area.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought I had a place through a family member but that person (like a husband of a fourth cousin) has gone completely MIA for over 3 weeks and a contract hasn't been signed with that person, though the place is definitely supposed to be vacated next month. (it seems like the previous tenants were section 8 (I presume that's correct?) and the city will not pay anymore or that's what I understand the city's lawyer has communicated) Anyways, I thought I had a sure thing and, now, I'm stuck having to find a replacement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a guarantor that makes over 100k. I can't show enough for the income rule and I keep getting \"well the guarantor isn't gonna live there\" thrown at me, so I'm like wtf is the point in offering to accept a guarantor if you're going to dismiss the guarantor because they're not gonna live there? (/end rant) \n\nThe only idea that I can think of that I haven't tried is to ask about is if I pay additional months' rent up front. Does anyone have any ideas? This is such fun situation (/s)","author_fullname":"t2_13ccph","title":"Stuck without an apartment to move to at last minute with an unfortunate situation in terms of credentials for finding an apt...any suggestions on how to remedy?
