    "text": "I've always been interested in working in politics, but life got in the way several times. Long story short, due to some missteps and an unidentified/untreated learning issue, I took 5 years to finish undergrad and 2.5 to finish grad school. I've held multiple internships throughout, but never a full-time job.\n\nI recently finished my MA in International Relations and I'm very eager to find an opportunity on a Congressional or Senate staff. Given my lack of full-time experience, I'm curious how to put my best foot forward. It seems almost mandatory to cut your teeth with an internship, but at 28 I feel behind the eight ball. That being said, with an MA and several internships, I also feel worthy and capable of having a paying job.\n\nI loosely know one person who works as an LA in the Senate, but I haven't spoken to them in 5 years. Other than that I have no connections on the Hill. I do, however, know that this is the career I want to pursue. Will I have to swallow my pride and find an internship, or is there some other way of becoming a Staff Assistant besides applying cold and praying?",
