    "text": "Hi all, \n\nSo I’m a recent graduate looking for a job in D.C. I have 4.5 years of combined experience through my full-time job and my internships. I’m\nprimarily interested in working with policy makers, think tanks, and non-profits. Obviously, now is not the time I am expecting a plethora of interviews or job offers. However, to those actively hiring, I have not been able to get an interview. \n\nI applied to a position through a staffing agency called The Ford Agency and I was informed that the position was placed on hold but that they could help me with my job search.\n\nThey are a staffing agency so of course they could do temp staffing, etc. However, I’m not a local to D.C. because I’m a recent graduate and the pandemic halted my plan to move there to find a job and be “local”. Therefore, permanent staffing is important. \n\nI want to know if any of you had prior experiences with staffing agencies for full-time positions; any experience with the Ford Agency would be tremendous, as well!\n\nThanks.",
