Tried to apply online and when I got to the main screen, it said my social security number didn't match what I originally entered. Maybe I was flustered and in a hurry and made a typo, who knows. But there's no way to see what I originally entered as my SS#!\n\nNow I'm on hold and feel like this is how I'll be spending my entire day. Anyone else have this issue?",
