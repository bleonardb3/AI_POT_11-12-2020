    "text": "Hi, hope everyone is doing well and staying healthy! I'm looking for some advice about grad school. I lived in VA all my life/ did undergrad at a VA school, and then moved to DC for a job and changed residency this past August. I'm now realizing this might have been a mistake since grad schools are SO much more as an out of state resident. I'd like to go to a VA or MD school- is my only option to move there for a year or so and then claim the in state tuition? I have been financially independent for two years, so don't think I could pretend to still live with my parents. Thanks in advance!",
