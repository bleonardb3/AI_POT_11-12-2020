    "text": "Hi! I bought a car this Feb and was planned to register in dc. So I paid DC car sale tax when I bought. Currently, I am moving to Portland, Oregon soon. And there is no sale tax in Portland. I havenâ€™t had car inspection down because my appointment got canceled due to coronavirus. So since I am going to use the car in Portland and register in Portland. Is there anyone know if I can get my sale tax back from DC dmv?",
