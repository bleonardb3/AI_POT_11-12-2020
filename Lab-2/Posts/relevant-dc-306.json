    "text": "Hello, I recently moved to Amsterdam for a couple of years for a job, and to get a drivers license here I can surrender my US one in exchange. The NL government will apparently send back the license to the DC DMV with a letter saying I have surrendered it. I am curious if anyone has any experience with this or knows what would happen with my DC residency. Would DC just ignore this as some embassies do for passports? Would this prevent me from applying for a license again in the future?",
