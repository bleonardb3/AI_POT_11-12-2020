{"text":" Hi guys! Hope everyone is well and staying safe. Please can someone share with me some info about NYC unemployment?!?! I filed and it all went through the system but I need to know what's going on with the direct deposit. I signed up for direct deposit but when I sign in it says payment is debit card. I can't get that mail in NYC and have no idea what's going on. Did this happen to anyone?? Please help thanks!!!! \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/g1css2)","author_fullname":"t2_67rl1z1i","title":"NYC UNEMPLOYMENT"}
