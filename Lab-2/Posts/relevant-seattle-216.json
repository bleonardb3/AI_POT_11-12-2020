    "text": "Hey all, I'm fairly new in town and I'm still getting familiar with a lot in the city. \n\nI parked in a spot yesterday that had a \"No Parking Anytime\" sign posted that I did not see. \n\nI was gone for about an hour and I got a ticket. \n\nThe ticket itself wasn't a big deal and I already paid for it. But my question about some comments the officer left on the ticket \n\nIt says: \"Impound. No Parking Anytime. Picture Taken.\" \n\nWhat does that comment mean exactly? Is my car due to be towed? \n\nThanks",
