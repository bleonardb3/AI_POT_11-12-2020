    "text": "Hi all,\n\nHas the DC government made any changes to parking restrictions as part of its COVID-19 response?  \n\nI don't want to metro in to the city to restrict my exposure.  However, if I could drive in and work from my office, I'd be more productive than working at home trying to concentrate while my 3 kids are running amok at home.  \n\nIf I have to pay $15 a day for a parking garage downtown, I will.  But I'd of course much rather than on-street parking in the District be easier and cheaper than it normally is.",
