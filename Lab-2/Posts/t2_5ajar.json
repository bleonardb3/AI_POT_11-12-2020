{"text":"Hey Everyone,\n\nI work a corporate job Monday-Friday and bartend weekends (New Yorks expensive u know).\n\nDue to the current situation, the bar has closed and my corporate job has cut  hours. I am now making 50% of what I was prior to the outbreak.\n\nMy question for you all is if I qualify for any sort of partial unemployment? Can anyone offer some advice?\n\nThanks all, be safe!","author_fullname":"t2_5ajar","title":"Partial Unemployment?"}
