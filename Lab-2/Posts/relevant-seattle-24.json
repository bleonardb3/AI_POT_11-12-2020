    "text": "So my income dropped 20% due to Covid, but at least I wasn't laid off.   As a result I logged in to wahealthplanfinder and applied for apple health for the kids - we qualified.  Now my pay check came in and there is no 20% off, however there may be in two weeks.....\n\n-So my question, can I ride this out and just change the status if the 20% never comes out?\n-There was no income verification, should I just let it go?\n-Since the reduction may be temporary, what is the right thing to do?",
