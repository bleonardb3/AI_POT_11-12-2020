{"text":"Don't know if this is the right place to post, so I apologize if I am incorrect. I just haven't been in this position before, and I am sure there will be more people in the same boat in NYC.\n\nAt the end of the workday yesterday, I was told via a group phone call that we are no longer needed for the time being, due to concerns about the corona virus pandemic. It was all very vague, and we all quickly hung up.\n\nI know that I can try to file for unemployment on Monday, and have immediately canceled the few subscription services that I have, in order to save money, as well as making my food at home and not going out at all for the past few weeks. I generally keep to myself, so the social isolation thing kind of takes care of itself anyway.\n\nBut I am just looking for any advice concerning what to do regarding resources in finding jobs, my rights/options as an apartment renter in NYC, health services, etc. Any information about anything would be greatly appreciated, thanks.","author_fullname":"t2_dcahm","title":"So I was just laid off.
