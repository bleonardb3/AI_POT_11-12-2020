    "text": "DC has decided to increase the assessed value of my apartment by $50,000 just over the last year (and ~$20k the year before). Over this period of time, the estimates on Redfin/Zillow have actually decreased, and those estimates don't take into account other emergent problems with the building that would likely decrease value. HOWEVER--even these increased values are still lower than what I bought it for and hopefully still less than it's worth. So my questions are:\n\n1. Is there a risk that appealing the increase leads the assessors to decide that it's actually worth *more* and further increase the assessment?\n\n2. Has anyone had any success appealing these?\n\nThanks",
