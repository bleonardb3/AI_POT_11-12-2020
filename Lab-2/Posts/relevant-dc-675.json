    "text": "I want to accept this internship in DC, but I am concerned I will not be making enough to live there. The internship pays 13.25/hr for 3 or 6 months depending on my choosing. It is full time \\~40 hrs/wk. \n\nThe thing is I went to school in DC a while back and my old roommates offered to let me split a large basement space in the their house in NW for $500/mo + utilities. My folks pay for my phone plan and health insurance, but besides that I'll be on my own. I know it's expensive to live in DC, but I am interested in this internship and the rent is a good deal from my understanding. What do you all think, can I make it work?",
