    "text": "Morning, all. Long story short, I’m the upstairs tenant of a converted/split townhouse, haven’t had any issues with the tenants downstairs and they haven’t with me. In fact, we’ve always been pretty friendly with each other. I’m a firefighter and generally just come home and sleep, especially now with COVID and working a ton, but I’ve lived around the district to know that noise is inevitable. When it rattles the windows for 3 hours and I can hear the lyrics/discern what the tenants are shouting, I’d hope it’s justified to ask them to quiet it down, and when I did, we were both respectful and they abided for a bit, then it got loud again and eventually stopped but I didn’t do anything a second time just wanting to sleep before getting up at 3am. When I left at 4, one of them was literally waiting for me inside their front window to call me out for asking them to lower the music and decided they had issues with me “stomping around during the day but never reported it and I shouldn’t have done it either”. Even after trying to apologize and ask if we could talk it out with little to no reception, eventually I just had go to work. \n\nDid I do anything wrong here? Is there a better way to have dealt with the noise issue than trying to ask them in person? We’re all just young working people trying to be safe and get by, but if I was overreacting by asking at 3am to turn it down I’d like to know. Otherwise I’m kind of pissed of it turned into this.",
