I’ve got a handful of free drinks through their app. Healthcare professionals: reply to this thread with your Starbucks order and your pickup location (double-check the location is open and allows order ahead). I should be able to get 5-7 drinks for free – I'll reply once I've exhausted all my free drinks.\n\nI feel incredibly fortunate to have the ability to collect a full salary while working from home during all this. **Hats off to all the nurses, doctors and other healthcare professionals working during this mess. Hope everyone has a Happy Hump Day!**",
