    "text": "It looks like my girlfriend's residency at the Seattle VA is still starting July 1st which means we're planning on moving in mid-June. Our original plan was to visit in May to view apartments and check out neighborhoods we're interested in. However with everything going on, we've decided that we can probably just find a place we like online and through virtual tours. \n\nI've done plenty of reading and watched YouTube videos, but was looking to hear from people who live in the neighborhood we're interested in and what the day to day is like, what the community is like, can you walk to groceries/bars/restaurants, etc. We're interested in West Seattle, North Admiral, Beacon Hill and Columbia City.\n\nI realize it's probably not the ideal time to be moving out there, but so it is. I'm sure life is pretty nuts out there right now (although I'm in FL so not much better) but you guys seem like you're handling it as best you can and I'm excited to be a part of your community! Any help you can provide would be immensely helpful. Thanks a lot",
