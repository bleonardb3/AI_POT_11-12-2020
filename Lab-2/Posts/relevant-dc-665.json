    "text": "Hi there r/washingtondc \\- I know that many of you have been furloughed at some point in the past. I am getting furloughed at my job, albeit in the private sector so I recognize there may be differences. I know that while furloughed, I can apply for and receive unemployment. However, I have two questions about this: \n\n1. I know typically for unemployment, you have to demonstrate that you're looking for work. Since I'm furloughed, I won't be. Is this waived for furloughed individuals/ \n2. I also know that if you make any income, it is typically deducted from your unemployment check? Is this the same if you're furloughed? My company is paying is 20% to cover benefits so will the unemployment agency deduct that amount from my unemployment check (essentially wiping it out since 20% of my monthly salary is most of the max unemployment benefit)? If this is the case, do they deduct net or gross? Finally, do you know if they deduct payment made from using PTO? \n\nObviously I will ask the unemployment agency too, but wanted to see if anyone knew in the meantime as I work on my budget. Thanks for any help!",
