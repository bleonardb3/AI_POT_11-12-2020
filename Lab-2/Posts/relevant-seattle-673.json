    "text": "Hello, I’m planning ahead for my boyfriends birthday in the summer and wanted to rent a vintage car for the day. Something like a\n1985 Mercedes-Benz 380-Class 380SL 2-Door Convertible or a car with a similar aesthetic will do. \n\nI saw some options on Turo in the area but unfortunately they only rent to 30+ year olds and I’m 26.\n\nAnyone know of any other options in Seattle area I could look into? \n\nOf course this is also contingent on whether or not quarantine is still in place by the end of summer.\n\nThank you :)",
