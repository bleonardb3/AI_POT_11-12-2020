    "text": "Hi! With being locked in the house because of COVID, I've started to entertain the idea of solar on our flat roof. I have excellent sun exposure pretty much all day with a large roof area. I started to look around and do some research but all these solar websites keep asking me for my address and phone number to reach out to me before any quotes and it just feels kinda shady. I did it one time last year and kept getting calls from various vendors which caused me to be overwhelmed and kinda give up.\n\nAny one in the district recently go solar? Any suggestions or tips on recommended vendors, how financing works for these, and understanding what and how SRECs work?\n\nAppreciate it all!",
