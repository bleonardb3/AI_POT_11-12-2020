{"text":"I filed for unemployment online, filled out the Direct Deposit info, and then claimed benefits the next week on the phone which is now pending.  I claimed them again last week on Wednesday.  I still haven't received anything, and when I call is says pending.  How long is this supposed to take?  Am I maybe missing something I was supposed to do to make this go through?  its been over 2 weeks, and it's impossible to get a human being on the phone for help.","author_fullname":"t2_4ndsv","title":"How long does it take for a pending claim for unemployment benefits to go through?"}
