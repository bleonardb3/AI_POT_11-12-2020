    "text": "Hi All,  \n  \nI know everyone is probably tired of the unemployment questions so thank you if you are seeing this and attempting to help me. My small office and company closed down completely because of COVID-19 (last day of employment was March 31st and I know this disqualifies me for the first week I claimed but the person I spoke to advised me to start filing when I did). 2 of my co-workers applied a day before I did (I was on March 23rd) and began receiving their money early last week. As I applied the next day, I assumed I would be a day or two behind them but as of today, nothing. So I ask my other co-worker if he got approved and he said yes, and he filed a week after I did.   \n  \nWhen I go online to SAW, all my weekly claims say 'Disqualified' but I do not have a Decisions Status yet. From what I've seen, everyone who has applied but hasn't received payment, all have 'Pending' statuses for their weekly claims and not 'Disqualified' but I'm not sure if they have the Decisions Status yet or not.   \n  \nSo my question is, Can anyone tell me if they were originally 'Disqualified' and then moved to 'Pending' and then to 'Paid'? Is that typical?   \n  \nI've sent an email, just today, to ESD and am obviously waiting to hear back which can take up to 4 business days. I've also requested a call back but the earliest they have is May 28, 6 weeks out. I know I need to keep filing my claims in the meantime but if anyone can shed some light on the situation that would be great.  \n  \nThank you!",
