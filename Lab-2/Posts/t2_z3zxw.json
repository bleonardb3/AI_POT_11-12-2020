{"text":"Hi all, like many I have just found myself with out a job and just sitting at home with upcoming rent bills. My lease doesn't end until July and I doubt I could find anyone to move on right now to take over. If I went back to my home state I know there's a job waiting for me and a rent free room at a parent's house so I'm really considering leaving since all my work has been cancelled for the foreseeable future, but am I really stuck in my lease? And with the new travel restrictions I'm not sure if I could rent a car to drive home. I'm in a position where I'll be okay for about the end of May but if I don't have any money coming in soon I can't stay. I know lots of people have left rather hastily due to the upcoming travel restrictions but I just am not prepared to leave right now. Any advice?","author_fullname":"t2_z3zxw","title":"Stuck?"}
