    "text": "I'm looking at jobs in the DC area and I'm wondering if anyone can give me some general thoughts on what health insurance is good and bad in the DC area.  For example, my gut feeling is United Healthcare is lousy.  Is that true in the DC area?  What about Blue Cross Blue Shield?  Is Cigna good, or do I just think that because when I lived in the area my particular plan was decent?",
