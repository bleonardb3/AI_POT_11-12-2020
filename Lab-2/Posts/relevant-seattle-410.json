    "text": "The restaurant I'm working at has reopened for to go orders. I was a bartender. Last week, I worked 9 hours in the kitchen, meaning much less per hour and of course less hours worked.\n\nAs I continue working in the kitchen I grow concerned that, once my unemployment finally kicks in (still waiting on wage info from another state to put me over 680hr threshold), I might disqualify myself because I am working, but not working nearly enough to pay my bills.\n\nDoes anyone know where to find the info that I need? I could really use some help as I have been unsuccessfully navigating unemployment land for over a month now.",
