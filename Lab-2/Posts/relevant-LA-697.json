    "text": "I have a toll roads account and Fastrak transponder. I have been using metro express lanes on the 110 and not getting charged a toll. Do I need a separate metro express lanes account or transponder? I thought my toll roads transponder could be used all over. Of course looking online has been of no use. Will call the help center if/when I get the chance but hoping someone has some insight. Thanks!",
