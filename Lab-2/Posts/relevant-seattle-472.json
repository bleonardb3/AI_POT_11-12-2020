    "text": "I recently got hired in Kent and my husband is active duty NAVY working in Bangor. We are moving to WA in June. \n\nWhat is a good middle ground location for us to live? Open to using the ferry system but nervous about availability/reliability.  \n\nOther considerations are that my husband will be deployed 6 month out of the year and we have a child in daycare. \n\nAnything else we should consider?",
