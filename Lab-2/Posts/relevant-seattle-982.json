    "text": "When I first moved into the complex, I signed a lease that had $150 pet deposit with no pet rent. One month later, the complex was sold to a new property management company who honored my agreement. \n\nFlash forward to almost the end of my lease - The new company sent me a lease renewal agreement with a $200 pet deposit and $50/month per pet. Is the new deposit legal? And is there any way around the new pet rent that I never had to pay before? (wishful thinking) \n\nTo top it all off, they have added a mandatory $11 Liability Coverage on top of the base rent.  Per the property manager, \"This is to cover damages in case the tenant causes a fire or flood, but it's not \"renters insurance\".\"\n\nCan anyone vet these added fees??   \n**New Pet Deposit**  \n**Mandatory Liability Coverage Added**  \nAnd any way to negotiate waiving the pet rent? \n\nTIA!",
