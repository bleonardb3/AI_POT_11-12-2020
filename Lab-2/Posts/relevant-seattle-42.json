    "title": "East African young men are massacring each other in Seattle and nobody is talking about it (warning: long post)",
    "text": "I am a young Somali man from Seattle and over the past several years, I've witnessed an incredible decline in basic security in South Seattle. Young East African men - Somalis, Oromo, Habesha - are killing each other with increasing frequency. Two days ago,  a friend of mine (Somali) called me to tell me his younger brother had shot somebody in the head in Tukwilla in front of the Abu Bakr Mosque. Several weeks before that, my mother called me to tell me that my childhood best friend (Oromo) was dead - his corpse was discovered by a passerby in a North Seattle street. He too had been shot in the head. I cannot believe this is happening in Seattle, but it is.\n\nThese murders are accompanied by frequent gun crimes in East African majority neighborhoods - houses and cars are shot up, family members of gang members are intimidated with weapons. Innocent people are victims in the crossfire. My mom's friend was nearly murdered while making lunch for her family - stray bullets penetrated her kitchen as gangs exchanged gunfire in a nearby park.\n\nPetty personal disputes and heated spur-of-the-moment arguments motivates much of this violence. But from what I am hearing, the violence has escalated to encompass entire neighborhoods. East African youths in two low-income (technically \"mixed income\") housing developments - New Holly and Rainier Vista - have now been feuding for several years. Gangs members from one neighborhood will drive to the other, shoot somebody and then the other will retaliate. And the cycle continues. The worst part of this is that you don't have to be affiliated with the gangs to be targeted for murder. Merely living in any of these two neighborhoods and being a young East African man makes you part of this war, whether you want to or not. I have since moved out of Rainier Vista, but I feel incredible fear and anxiety visiting my family there. I fear for my young brother. Many Somali elders tell me they don't even feel safe inside their homes because of the stray bullets and frequent gun battles. It's a bitter irony, but Seattle has turned into Mogadishu 2.0 for the Somalis.\n\nI am constantly asked by baffled people - why are these young men killing each other? Why are they forming violent gangs? Why aren't the parents doing anything to stop this? I don't have a clear answer for these questions. I wish I  did - maybe then I could help solve this crisis. If I had to hypothesize, it would be:\n\n* Easy access to powerful guns (you can buy them off Facebook)\n* A pop culture that glamorizes violence among young black men\n* Families broken and traumatized by civil war\n* Breakdowns in parent-child relations in East African communities because of huge culture and language barriers\n* Unemployment and underemployment among young EA men\n* Access to illicit cash from credit card fraud and drugs\n* Indifference to the violence by city and state authorities because voters don't know what's happening and therefore don't hold them accountable\n\nI am deeply worried that this violence will not only **NOT** stop, but that it will become worse. This is because it has become too easy to kill and get away with it in Seattle - provided your victims are young East African men. The news articles that report the killings are always brief, they never mention any details on background or broader patterns, there are never follow up articles. And so the stories just fade away. Killers escape, the rule of law erodes. Once in a while there will be a bigger Seattle Times report, and quotes from a few officials saying they are \"concerned\" about the violence. The solution will be to give some grant money to a local East African community center for \"youth summer enrichment programs.\" These programs are great, and I'm not trying to disparage these community centers - but let's be honest, the young men behind all of these killings aren't going to summer painting classes with nine year olds.\n\nI understand that local news agencies and authorities don't want to publicize this particular issue because it will be used to feed racist and anti-immigrant narratives. I am deeply sympathetic to that perspective. But the silence on this issue is only allowing the problem to metastasize. Hardened killers are proliferating in South Seattle, and I'm afraid i'll be their next victim because I'm a young East African man from the wrong neighborhood. Raising awareness of the issue will force public action, and will save East African lives in our city. This is why I am speaking out. The laundry is dirty, but I'd rather be embarrassed than dead.\n\nI don't believe in complaining about an issue without proposing any solutions, so here are what I think are tough but reasonable steps that city/state authorities can take:\n\n* Destroy gang leadership. Identify gang ringleaders/charismatic members and send them to prison for a long time.\n* Expel from public housing the families of any gang members, or if they want to stay, have them agree to  no-contact orders with the gang member \\[this will rid the neighborhood of bad influence\\]\n* Create a reward program for reporting the illegal ownership or sale of guns\n* Increase penalties for illegally owning guns\n* Reduce parole eligibility for violent offenses \\[ I know a guy who was released from prison after serving only 3 years after he was arrested at the site of a violent gang shooting/murder in the international district - suffice to say he was not an innocent bystander\\]\n* Ban pitch-dark window tints on cars\n\nReading over these suggestions, they sound really harsh and draconian. But the situation is very bad and it requires a serious and swift response. It's not normal that I should hear machine gunfire from my bedroom window while visiting family, or that seemingly every week a young East African man loses his life. If the city continues on ignoring this problem, it will not disappear. It will get worse. And these crimes will spread to other parts of the city and more innocent people will die.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for the kind words, encourgements, silver and platinum. You guys---and gals and gender non-identifying people (Seattle you've trained me well)--- are awesome!",
