    "text": "Is there a business that buys used tires in the area? I have some very pricy high-end winter studded tires (Nokian Hakkapeliita, from Finnland) from my truck. I moved to a smaller place and might not need them in the mild climate here. Is there any place I can sell them? I tried calling around and googling; no luck. Willing to let go for not much.\n\nOr, is there a tire storage service? Paying $50 for a storage unit is too much.\n\nOr does anyone here want to buy? I'll let go real cheap. P265/75R16",
