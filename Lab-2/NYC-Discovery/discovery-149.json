  "text": "So I filed for unemployment over 3 weeks ago and it still says pending status and I have not heard anything about the amount. My three other coworkers filed on the same day and theirs all went through. My mom and I canâ€™t get through to anyone but the situation is getting scary. How much longer would waiting be considered normal. Also do part time workers get the additional $600? \nThanks.",
