  "text": "I may get downvoted for this but oh well. \n\nI’m a dog walker in NYC. I love my job and I’ve been doing this for 5+ years. \n\nHowever with the COVID-19 issues going around, a very large portion of my income is gone. I have 60% of my clients working from home and their dogs don’t need me. \n\nWhile I understand the social distancing, try to utilize your dog walkers at least once a week or something if you income isn’t impacted, some of us need the money and don’t have a large enough savings built up. \n\nI’m grateful I do have savings but a lot of independents and freelancers are struggling. \n\nThanks for listening to my feelings.",
