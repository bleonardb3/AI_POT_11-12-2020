  "text": "I know most of the world is laid off right now and apparently most of NYC but i can’t get through to unemployment at all!!! I’ve been calling for hours i don’t understand why they couldn’t complete my claim online. Is there a center i can go to in person? I’d rather wait in line  then to call back to back to back to get some automated system that hangs up on me or actually get through to the menu, enter all my info and have it hang up on me AGAIN after I’m supposed to be transfers to a rep. I have to pay my rent and my partner is also laid off. He got approved but his benefits aren’t going to come for 2-3 weeks it says .. and i can’t even get through to get mine approved. ANY advice seriously I’m spinning out here",
