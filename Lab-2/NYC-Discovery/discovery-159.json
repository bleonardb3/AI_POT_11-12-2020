  "text": "Hey everyone. 19 year old nyc college student here. So back when COVID-19 ramped up and began shutting workplaces down, I was furloughed from my sales associate job and told to file for unemployment. So I did. A little bit before the pandemic started, I started a another part time job (extremely part time). Though I got furloughed from my main part time job, the latter part time job allows me to work from home during this time. I only work once or twice a week with this job from home. I recently got a warning from unemployment about not reporting income. I did not report it due to the payment processing at this job being delayed due to the virus, but reported it when I got the warning. Am I still eligible to receive unemployment benefits as someone who was furloughed from one job but still working from home at another (as long as I report income and days worked)? I would think that since I was initially eligible for it I would still be, but the warning made me uneasy about claiming benefits. Unemployment and all the terms attached to it can get a little confusing and the last thing I want to do is make a mistake and get charged by the state for overpayment or mistakenly get charged with fraud.",
