  "text": "So In 2017 I was on unemployment in NY. I had a Key2Benefits debit card.\n\nThis card expired in 2019.\n\nI just filed a claim a. few days ago. My payment history says payment released today April 21st 2020\n\nSeeing as how my card expired in 2019\n\nWill they be sending me a new debit card?\n\nShould I assume the card is already on it's way to me seeing as how the payment was released already?\n\nedit: IM not sure if I need to request one with Key Bank or if they will just send me one. The wait is 4 hours to speak to a representative.\n\nTHANKS for any help",
