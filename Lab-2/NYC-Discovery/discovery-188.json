I don’t know how to afford life here. Even with me collecting unemployment it’s still not enough because bills and rent. The toughest part is that I can’t even really look for a new job because who is hiring during this time. \n\nFor real, screw coronavirus and all the damage it’s causing to everyone and their loved ones.",
