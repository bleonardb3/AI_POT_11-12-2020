  "text": "Hi All,\n\nI lost my job on the 17th of March due to Covid19, and applied for unemployment the same day. I didnâ€™t need to call and finished my application online. \n\nI checked this morning and it still says my claim is pending? I have not received any funds yet though I have filled out the claim benefits questionnaire already. \n\nIs anyone else having the same situation??\n\nEdit: my message in my inbox says 3-6 weeks but I thought that was being waived??",
