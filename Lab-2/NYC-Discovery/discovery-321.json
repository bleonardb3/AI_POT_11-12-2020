  "text": "I recently go furloughed (according to the letter March 23) however they didn’t notify me until April 2nd. I was able to file my claim on April 3rd and claimed on Monday April 6th. I checked the payment history this morning and it’s paying me for the week ending April 5th but not the week ending on the 29th? \n\nI claimed as soon as I could and was wondering if there’s a way to remedy this or if anyone had additional info? Google has given me nothing so far. \n\nThanks!",
