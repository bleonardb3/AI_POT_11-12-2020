I claimed them again last week on Wednesday.  I still haven't received anything, and when I call is says pending.  How long is this supposed to take?  Am I maybe missing something I was supposed to do to make this go through?  its been over 2 weeks, and it's impossible to get a human being on the phone for help.",
