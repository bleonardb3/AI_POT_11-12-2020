  "text": "I filed originally under the old system on 3/24, was never able to make it through, then they chagned the system around 10 days ago. I got a recording saying someone would call me within 72 hours and that I don't need to file with the new system. They never called. So I filed again under the new system about four days ago. I got a printout saying someone would call me within 72 hours. Nobody did.\n\nI don't know if this is typical or not.\n\nEdit: I should mention I didn't lose my job due to covid, it happened a few months ago and I never bothered to file becuase I thought I'd find a new job quickly... but covid made me realize that isn't going to happen anytime soon so I'm rushing to file now. I know, that was really stupid.",
