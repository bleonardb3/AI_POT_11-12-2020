  "text": "I filed on 12/30/2019 through TurboTax, and I checked my status on the NYS Dept of Taxation website and it says:  \"We sent you a letter requesting information to verify the amount withholding you claimed on your return\". I double checked my W2 and the information submitted and they match perfectly. Whatever. I sent them the additional W2 info directly on their site on 3/14. It's 4/3 and no refund or update. I searched online and apparently hundreds of other NYers got similar notices. Is this a stalling/delaying tactic because NYS is low on funds due to buying resources for the pandemic? Need this money more than ever and I filed super early",
