  "text": "I’m moving from Canada to New York for grad school this fall and have a few logistical questions that are stressing me out:\n\n\\-I’m a student so will not be making 40x rent and have no local guarantor. I know that there are lease guarantor services, but I really do not want to be paying if there are other ways I can prove financial ability. Has anyone been in a similar situation, what have you done? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-I’m only allowed to land in the US 30 days before the start of my program because of Visa requirements. Is it feasible to find a place in this time-frame? Would it be recommended to find a place online before I land or to land and apartment search once I'm in the country?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny input is appreciated, thank you!!",
