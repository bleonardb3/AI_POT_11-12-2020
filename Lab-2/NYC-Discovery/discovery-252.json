  "text": "Howdy Everyone, \n\nQuestion / Advice Needed\n\nI applied for unemployment benefits mid march , and finally got through the overloaded call system system to finish my application / confirm with a real person the week after.  In my online gateway here [applications.labor.ny.gov/Individual/](https://applications.labor.ny.gov/Individual/) when i click on  \"unemployment services\" and get brought to the second domain [uihp2.labor.ny.gov](https://uihp2.labor.ny.gov) to submit my weekly claims for benefits, for the past 2 weeks i have had a \"Weekly benefit amount\" of $0.00 and a maximum payable amount of $0.00... (for direct deposit) This has me a bit worried. I filed as an independent contractor but there is no way for me to speak to anyone about this because the call service will not work for me anymore as i already have completed my claim... There is a notice on the page that states \"Your claim is in pending status. No payments have been made on your claim.\" \n\nHas this happened to anyone else? \n\nAny advice / solutions? \n\nDo you think since i registered as an independent contractor that i am not eligible for payments or could it be that they have not gotten around to making payments\n\nThanks Gentlemen",
