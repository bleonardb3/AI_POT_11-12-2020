  "text": "Filed for unemployment as a result of COVID-19 closure. Two payments have been released to the debit card since I filed two weeks ago, however I have not received the debit card in the mail yet. I have also tried to register for direct deposit numerous times, fill out the online form, and get no test deposits or any confirmation of it going through. Should I be worried my card got lost in the mail? I live in an apt building so Iâ€™m wondering if I should ask my neighbors?",
