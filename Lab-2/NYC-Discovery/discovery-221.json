  "text": "I was laid off this Monday (3/30) and tried to file for unemployment. I was able to successfully get through and submit my link but then saw that the NYS state updated the states for independent contractors here ([https://labor.ny.gov/ui/pdfs/self-employed-ui-guide.pdf](https://labor.ny.gov/ui/pdfs/self-employed-ui-guide.pdf)). After looking over the PDF, I realized that I had submitted my claim wrong and I wanted to file a new claim following the right steps. After I sign in, when I go to the unemployment portal and click on unemployment claims, it takes me to a page that says download your 2019 taxes. \n\nAfter I try to download it, the page errors out with a message saying \"**We're sorry, we are unable to serve you at this time due to technical difficulties or scheduled downtime for internal processing.\"** I've repeated the steps all morning and it keeps taking me back to this page. I am new to filing unemployment and have no clue what to do to file the claim and get to the next step. After I submit, do I try to get through on the phone? I've also heard it's impossible and am starting to think I will never get my benefits at all. Can anyone please help?",
