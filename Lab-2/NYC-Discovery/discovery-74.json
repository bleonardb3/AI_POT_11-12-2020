  "text": "I lost my restaurant job 2 weeks ago and was told to claim my first benefits on 3/25. When I logged in it let me do so, but showed \"unemployment claim pending\" and \"weekly benefits $0.\" This hasn't changed since then. I did receive mail from D.O.L. with a monetary estimate for benefits, which seemed like a good sign. I wouldn't be so worried if it weren't for the fact that my gf filed at the same time as me and already has her debit card with payments on it. Anybody with D.O.L. experience know why my claim is taking so long to process? Or, anyone else dealing with the same thing? I've also called them to no avail -- no possibility of talking to a real person. I'm getting worried that my restaurant screwed up or my claim was lost.",
