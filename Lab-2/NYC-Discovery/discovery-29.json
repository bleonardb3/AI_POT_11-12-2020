  "text": "I lost my job as a result of the virus and we are just relying on my wife's income for now. We traveled to Carnegie South Imaging for Women on Madison and 32nd from Queens to perform some testing for downs syndrome and a few other things on my wife.  When we arrived they asked for the $300 deductible from my wife's insurance upfront. We explained that times are a little rough right now and asked if they can bill us or set up a payment plan but they said no, they needed payment upfront. My wife caused a bit of a scene and stormed out. I understand they have to look out for themselves but it made me a bit angry and I needed to vent and see if this is normal. In the past when we've had deductibles, the office would bill us and we would pay it when the bill came but this was the first time we've actually been denied a service for not being able to pay a deductible upfront.",
