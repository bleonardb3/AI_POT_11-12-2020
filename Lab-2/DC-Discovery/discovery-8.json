  "text": "Hey,\n\nI moved to DC a while ago, but was still a Florida voter because I was a college student and could maintain residency with my home state. Since I graduated and decided to stay here, I need to register to vote here now.\n\nI went to the DMV to get a driver's license and register in early march, but they turned me away because I had the wrong residency documents. Then the whole COVID-19 thing happened, and there is no way I'm going back in the DMV before this is over. I still want to register to vote though.  I found the  voter registration form online, but I'm a little confused about whether or not I need to send in residency documents.  The DC website says that mail-in registers need to, but the online form doesn't mention anything. I just don't want to send in the form on its own, and then get told one month later that I need to send in residency docs.",
