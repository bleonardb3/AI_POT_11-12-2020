I live alone without a car away from both grocery stores and restaurants (love this stretch of Capitol Hill otherwise) and I want to make sure to not impose my costs on the restaurant (or the driver). Without getting into specifics, there are some services that charge what I consider to be outrageous amounts of money for doing next to nothing other than routing a driver to pick up the order and processing the ingestion of the data, forcing the driver to subsist on tips and the restaurant to eat the costs.",
