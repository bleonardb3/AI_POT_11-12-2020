  "text": "Howdy everyone,\n\nUnfortunately I'm riding out the current pandemic at home back in Oklahoma.  I drove my '02 Subaru Outback out here and will be driving back... that being 1350 miles split between 2x10-hour days.  I've been taking my car out to a shop near some friends in Arlington for service but now wanting to take it somewhere else for a \"second opinion\".  Does anyone have any solid recommendations?",
