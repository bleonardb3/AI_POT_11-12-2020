  "text": "Hi everyone, I am moving to DC for the first time. I’ve done an extensive search on apartments that are near public transportation that I could take to work. I found an apartment near P and 9th and another near U and 14th. Suppose I am indifferent between the prices of the two apartments, is one area significantly less safe than the other? In particular, walking home from a metro station or bus stop in the evenings. Both areas have great bars & restaurants but should I be wary of walking proximate to either of those intersections? I’m aware U and 14th is probably super loud on weekends. \n\nThanks for your help and insight in advance!",
