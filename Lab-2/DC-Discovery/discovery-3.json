  "text": "Here out of desperation, because the UI benefits phone line might as well not exist. 2 days, total of 12 hours, and nothing. Not to mention the IVR is so terrible, there are 5 minute pauses after every sentence. It was making me psychotic.\n\nI thought about just submitting my application online and letting the cards fall as they may, but figured this was worth a chance first.\n\nI have two full-time jobs in DC, one has been furloughed. The other may be eventually, but it looks like we keep marching on this week, at least (I am a federal contractor at this job, private sector for other). Can I apply for unemployment for one job while still working the other full time? If the other furloughs, can I apply for UI both in DC? If not, can I cancel this one and move forward with other job, since that one pays FAR more?\n\nThere is also a question about which job is most recent that I can't really answer since BOTH are most recent. I figured it was really asking which job I am applying for, so I chose that one as an answer, but don't want to, through system limitations, commit UI fraud.\n\nI know this is a desperate gambit, but I don't know what else to do.\n\nEdit: I also sent an email, but I'd be shocked if I received a reply by next week, if at all.\n\nEdit2: This is all due to the Covid-19 shutdowns. Many of us are facing this process here in DC. If I get it figured out, feel free to DM me.\n\nEdit3 3/18/20: Finally reached someone! However, I am calling back because the person I caught was completely unprofessional, and, to be upfront, I could barely understand him. On top of that, he was very argumentative and didn't seem to understand my questions. From what little I gathered, it seems clear that I can apply, but if my wages from other job surpass the furloughed one, I will not qualify. If I am furloughed for second job, I can apply for both, but not really. I would just add the total pay I would have received for both jobs in that base period, and earn the maximum, which is what I also expected. But, gosh, that guy was so unhelpful I am calling back just in case. It may also be worth a call back next week as DC passes more and more updates on the law.\n\nEdit4: Yep, most definitely can't apply right now, but can for both if (when?) other job is furloughed. How I would do it for both on website is unclear, but I will cross that hoop if (when?) I get there.\n\nThanks!",
