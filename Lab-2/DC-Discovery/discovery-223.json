  "text": "I'm considering taking a job in Georgetown for a year and a lot of apartments in the district nearby say there's street parking available. Do I have to have a residential parking permit to street park on all DC streets? I'm borrowing my parents' car from out of state and the insurance and title is under their name so I wouldn't qualify for it. Do Maryland or Virginia have similar rules for cars? What do you recommend I do in order to have a car without changing the insurance/title and not paying for a garage?",
