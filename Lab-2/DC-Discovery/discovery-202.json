  "text": "A family member is immunosuppressed and depressed and has been cooped up in the house for weeks except for going out for medical needs. I was thinking of trying to get them to go for a drive today somewhere within an hour of NW DC (the closer the better as they sometimes have an urgent need to use the bathroom). Where we could see some nice naturish views or cool houses/yards. I know there are some neighborhoods in Montgomery County that have cherry blossoms but my understanding is the blossoms should've fallen by now. We would be staying in the car, except for me getting some gas or if there is a desperate need to use a bathroom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit- Thanks for the responses!",
