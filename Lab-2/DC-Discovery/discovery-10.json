  "text": "So I will be starting at Georgetown Law and living on campus in the fall. I also plan to bike as much as I can. As for transportation to dc, I plan to drive to the city and also take the buses leaving from union station (I live in NY).  \n\nSo, my question: Georgetown estimates the cost of transportation to be  $3,276 / year in DC. That seems rather high to me. How much should I realistically budget for transportation on the metro per year? (10 months)\n\n\nEDIT: I should have clarified I do not own a car my parents would just drop me off for moving in/out. Sorry for the confusion!",
