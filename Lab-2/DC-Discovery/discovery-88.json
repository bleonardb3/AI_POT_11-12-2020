  "text": "Had my car window smashed sometime in the past 2 days near DuPont. Found it this morning with nothing stolen, didnâ€™t even take the hand sanitizer! Filed a report and waiting to hear a call back from an officer. Understanding that this is an unusual time for the PD, when do the officers get back to you? Assuming that they eventually do. Thanks!",
