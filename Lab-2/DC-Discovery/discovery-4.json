  "text": "Hey all - I'm not sure if this is the place to ask, but I recently moved to DC for a PSC position and am trying to figure out which health insurance to get. My employer will reimburse 72% of the monthly premium, so I'm thinking a no or low deductible plan would make the most sense even though they're a bit more expensive. \n\nI'm pretty healthy but who knows what could happen in the next couple of months with COVID-19. I would mainly be using it to fill a monthly prescription and for going to the doctor if I have an occasional severe illness (usually only get really sick like once or twice a year). \n\nThe best option on DC Health Link seems to be the Kaiser Permanente DC Standard Platinum 0/20/Dental for $396/mo. Does anyone have experience with this plan or know if it's easy to find providers that take it in the area? Other recommendations or advice? \n\nThank you!",
