  "text": "My job let me go on Monday and I need to find a new one ASAP or another source of income. I have enough savings for April’s rent and spendings but that’s it.\n\n- I will be filing for unemployment. Does anyone know how long the approval process will take? And how much is given?\n- Do you have any other suggestions as far as applying to jobs? Should I focus on applying for remote jobs only?\n- My background is restaurant/customer service and independent artist (watercolor/oil)\n\nThanks for your time and any insights you can give!\n\nEDIT: I really appreciate everyone who reply/dm me about this! Your support and encouragements means a lot to me. You guys are literally the best ❤️",
