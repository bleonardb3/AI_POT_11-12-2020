  "text": "Has anyone ever been to Quiet 17 Dental Care in NoMa? \n\nI'm looking for a new dentist. Been going to the same place for almost ten years, but it changed hands when the old dentist retried. I don't really like the new management - they try to push services I know I don't need and they convinced me to get a crown that has caused me nothing but trouble.\n\nQuiet 17 came up as a good option in my area, but open to other suggestions.",
