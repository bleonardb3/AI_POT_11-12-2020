  "text": "I moved to D.C. in January of this year and just signed a lease to stay until January of next year.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how much I need to make to live in/around D.C. and not feel broke living on my own.\n\nSome background info, I moved from Richmond, Va. I'm 23 and currently make 14 an hour (I'm doing an internship, woo for trying to move up in this world) and my background is in journalism. I live on U Street now and am moving near Cap Hill/Anacostia. I get a lot of help from my parents which I'm thankful for, but am looking to be self-sufficient and independent by the time I'm 25 (or sooner) because I'm tired of putting this on them. \n\nThe key is I want (need) to live alone. I'm not opposed to moving outside of D.C., I just need to be no more than a 45 minute commute from NoMa. \n\nI'm anticipating if I get an entry level job in my field, I'll make between 18-25 dollars an hour. So I'm just wondering where I could live with that salary, or much I need to be making to not completely struggle and feel like I can't live a life because I'm stretched thin for money between rent and bills.\n\nAny advice, tips are helpful--even if it's that I should not work in the D.C. area lol. I've read a lot on here, including the guide, but it's not that simple. Just need to start this planning and search now because I don't want to be scrambling come January 2021 and making ill-informed choices.",
