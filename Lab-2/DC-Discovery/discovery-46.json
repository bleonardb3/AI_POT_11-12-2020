(Mixed venue retail means several small businesses under a single roof, think Union Market-ish).\n\n1.  What are some of your fav up & coming neighborhoods and why do you love them?\n\n2. What makes that particular neighborhood a great location for a mixed retail venue?\n\n3. What types of business would you like to see in a mixed retail venue? Food, drinks, art, etc.\n\nLay it on me, Reddit!! 😁😊💜",
